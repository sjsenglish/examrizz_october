# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

## Git Commit Guidelines
- **IMPORTANT**: Always update this CLAUDE.md file before every git commit
- Include any new project conventions, patterns, or important decisions made during development

## Planning Mode
- Always ask clarifying questions when in planning mode
- Gather all necessary information before starting implementation
- Ensure full understanding of requirements before proceeding with code changes

## Critical Auth Flow Information (Updated Nov 2024)
- **DO NOT** add validation in login/signup pages that signs out users during OAuth callbacks
- OAuth users are automatically created by Supabase - let the process complete
- User profiles are created automatically via database trigger on auth.users INSERT
- The login page should simply redirect authenticated users to home
- Profile creation is handled by the database trigger in `/database/URGENT_FIX_USER_CREATION.sql`
