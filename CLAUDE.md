# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

## Git Commit Guidelines
- **IMPORTANT**: Always update this CLAUDE.md file before every git commit
- Include any new project conventions, patterns, or important decisions made during development

## Planning Mode
- Always ask clarifying questions when in planning mode
- Gather all necessary information before starting implementation
- Ensure full understanding of requirements before proceeding with code changes

## Critical Auth Flow Information (Updated Nov 2024)
- **DO NOT** add validation in login/signup pages that signs out users during OAuth callbacks
- OAuth users are automatically created by Supabase - let the process complete
- User profiles are created automatically via database trigger on auth.users INSERT
- The login page should simply redirect authenticated users to home
- Profile creation is handled by the database trigger in `/database/URGENT_FIX_USER_CREATION.sql`

## Landing Page Design (Updated Nov 2024)
- Cloud icons positioned closer to the island platform for better visual cohesion
- Cloud positioning in `components/landing/LandingHub.tsx`:
  - Big clouds: left-[20%] top-[30%], right-[20%] top-[45%]
  - Medium clouds: left-[38%] top-[25%], right-[38%] top-[27%]
- **Teacher icon**: Greyed out with opacity-40 and grayscale, made non-clickable (Nov 2024)
- **Learn icon**: Unlocked and clickable, links directly to `/competition` (updated Nov 2024)
- **Video icon**: Greyed out with opacity-40 and grayscale, made non-clickable (Nov 2024)
- **Arena icon**: Greyed out with opacity-40 and grayscale, made non-clickable (locked Nov 2024)

## Practice Page Design (Updated Nov 2024)
- Cloud decorations moved closer to title for better visual hierarchy
- Cloud positioning in `app/practice/page.tsx`:
  - Left cloud: left: 5%, top: 3%
  - Right cloud: right: 5%, top: 5%
## Video Page UI Changes (Nov 2024)
- The "Start maths series" button on `/video` page has been **disabled** (opacity: 0.5, cursor: not-allowed)
- The following buttons are **hidden** (display: none) but remain in code for potential future use:
  - "Select subject" dropdown
  - "Watch later" button
  - "Saved" button
- These elements can be re-enabled by removing the `display: 'none'` or `disabled` properties

## Competition and Subject Selection Flow (Nov 2024)
- **Competition page** (`/competition`):
  - Added back button (same style as practice page) in top left corner, linking to home page

  - Files: `app/subject-selection/page.tsx` and `app/subject-selection/subject-selection.css`

- **Maths Demo page** (`/maths-demo`):
  - Added back button linking to `/subject-selection` in top left corner (updated Nov 2024)
  - Moved treasure chest icon from 60x60 to 150x150 (2.5x bigger)
  - Relocated ghost character to bottom right corner (changed from `left: 60px` to `right: 60px`)
  - Repositioned speech bubble above ghost (changed from side positioning to `bottom: 180px` above ghost)
  - **Speech bubbles are now clean oval shapes** (border-radius: 30px for green ghost, 25px for love letter ghost)
  - **Both speech bubbles no longer have arrow pointers** - removed ::before pseudo-elements for cleaner look
  - Green ghost speech bubble moved to the left (right: -50px instead of -100px)
  - Love letter ghost speech bubble repositioned up and left (top: 10%, left: 14% instead of 12%, 20%)
  - Moved achievements sidebar (progress floating box) from top right to **bottom left corner**
  - **Enlarged sidebar**: width increased to 280px (from 200px), padding to 16px (from 10px)
  - **Increased sidebar font sizes**: label: 11px (from 9px), value: 13px (from 10px)
  - **Increased sidebar spacing**: margin-bottom: 10px, padding-bottom: 8px (from 6px/4px)
  - **Close button is now functional**: clicking × hides the sidebar via conditional rendering
  - **Top-left toast icon (toast-1) has pulse animation**: subtle scale from 1 to 1.05 over 2s loop
  - Adjusted toast icon positions to be higher up on screen (moved bottom toasts from 85-90% to 70-75%)
  - Moved toast-6 from left: 45% to left: 35% to avoid obscuring treasure chest
  - Shrank grass pattern from 100px to 60px, then further reduced to 54px (10% reduction)

    - **Progress bar** below search bar (top: 160px, fixed position, visible during scrolling)
    - **Spacing**: 90px gap between search bar and progress bar for clear visual separation
    - **Removed**: Title badge "Maths A Level - 90 hours" and left/right arrow buttons
    - **Progress Bar Features**:
      - Total duration: 92.83 hours displayed in center
      - Light cyan fill (#DBFCFF) showing cumulative progress based on current spec point
      - Love letter icon serves as draggable progress tracker
      - Treasure chest icon positioned at end of progress bar (100% completion)

      - Drag love letter icon to manually navigate between spec points
      - Progress automatically updates based on scroll position
    - **Icon Navigation**:
      - Love letter icon moves along progress bar based on cumulative hours completed
      - Interactive: click and drag to navigate to any spec point
      - Visual feedback: cursor changes to grab/grabbing during interaction
      - Smooth scrolling animation when navigating between spec points
    - **Progress Calculation**:
      - Dynamically calculates cumulative hours from spec point data
      - Position on bar represents percentage of total course completion
      - Updates in real-time as user scrolls through stepping stones
  - **Toast Icons**: Each toast represents one lesson within the spec point
    - **All toasts are clickable** (Nov 2024) - Link to `/spec-point-session` with parameters
    - URL format: `?spec={id}&lesson={number}&name={encoded name}`
    - Each toast links to its specific lesson session page
    - Hover effect: scale(1.1) on all toast icons
    - Toast arrangement: Flex layout with wrapping, max-width 154px per group (Nov 2024)
  - **Styling Details**:
    - **Vertical positioning** (Updated Nov 2024): Stepping stones moved down 10% on page for better visual balance
      - Desktop padding-top: 260px (increased from 180px)
      - Tablet padding-top: 200px (increased from 140px)
      - Mobile padding-top: 170px (increased from 120px)
    - **Horizontal spacing** (Updated Nov 2024): Levels positioned closer together for tighter layout
      - Desktop gap: 100px (reduced from 180px)
      - Tablet gap: 90px (reduced from 160px)
      - Mobile gap: 80px (reduced from 140px)
    - **Chapter signposts** (Updated Nov 2024): Positioned to appear in grass area near divider line
      - **CRITICAL**: These values are calculated based on wrapper extending 80px below viewport and grass fixed at bottom: 64px
      - Desktop: bottom: 118px (NOT negative - positions signpost to appear in grass with ~70px visible above grass divider line)
      - Tablet: bottom: 133px (adjusted for 135px signpost height)
      - Mobile: bottom: 148px (adjusted for 120px signpost height)
      - **DO NOT use negative values** - they push signposts below viewport making them invisible
      - Positioning calculation: Grass top is at 118px from viewport bottom; wrapper bottom extends 80px below viewport; positive bottom value keeps signposts visible in grass area
    - **Background** (Updated Nov 2024): Full background SVG image
      - Image URL: Firebase storage `background-grey-updated.svg`
      - Background applied to `.stepping-stones-container` with `background-attachment: local`
      - Background repeats horizontally (repeat-x) so users see more as they scroll
      - Background positioned at bottom, auto height scaling to 100% of viewport
      - Scrolls with stepping stones content while maintaining viewport-relative sizing
      - Replaces previous grass pattern and divider line
      - **Image rendering optimization** (Updated Nov 2024): Enhanced SVG quality with multiple rendering optimizations:
        - `image-rendering: high-quality` and `optimizeQuality` for crisp rendering
        - `transform: translateZ(0)` and `backface-visibility: hidden` for GPU acceleration
        - `-webkit-optimize-contrast` for WebKit browsers
        - `-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic` for smooth scaling in IE/Edge
    - Progress bar: 80% width, centered, with responsive sizing for mobile
    - Back button in top-left corner linking to `/subject-selection`
    - **Icon sizes** (optimized for 5 topics in view - Nov 2024):
      - Toast icons: 38x38px
      - Bar/platform: 132x33px
      - Ghost character: 77x77px
      - Ghost position: top: -50px
    - **Spec info typography** (Nov 2024):
      - ID: 14px
      - Name: 12px
      - Time badge: 11px
      - Min-width: 132px
  - **Files**:
    - Page: `app/maths-demo/page.tsx`
    - Styles: `app/maths-demo/maths-demo.css`

**Navigation Flow**: Home (Learn icon) → Competition → Subject Selection → Maths Demo → Spec Topic

## AskBo Page Layout Fix (Nov 2024)
- **Issue**: Page experienced layout shift on initial load - loading screen had different structure than actual content
- **Root cause**: Loading spinner showed full-page centered layout, then jumped to Navbar + sidebar layout when loaded
- **Fix implemented** in `/app/askbo/page.tsx` and `/app/askbo/study-book.css`:
  - Changed loading pattern to conditionally render content instead of early return
  - Navbar now remains visible during loading state
  - Loading spinner positioned below navbar (margin-top: 60px, min-height: calc(100vh - 60px))
  - Loading container uses transparent background to match page background
  - Main content wrapped in fragment that only renders when loading completes
  - This eliminates visual "jump" and provides smooth transition from loading to loaded state
- **Note**: This fix does NOT affect any functionality - only improves visual experience

## AskBo Authentication Required (Nov 2024)
- **Authentication**: `/askbo` page now requires user login
- **Behavior**: Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to `/login` page
- **Implementation** in `/app/askbo/page.tsx`:
  - Auth check runs on page mount via useEffect
  - If `supabase.auth.getUser()` returns no user, redirect to `/login`
  - If auth error occurs, redirect to `/login`
  - Loading state prevents content flash before redirect
- **Note**: This ensures all AskBo interactions are properly tracked and associated with user accounts
## Practice Pages UI Changes (Nov 2024)
- **Practice page** (`/practice`):
  - Admissions dropdown now excludes English Lit, Maths, Chemistry, Biology (only shows TSA, BMAT, Interview)
  - A Level button is now disabled and greyed out (opacity: 0.5, cursor: not-allowed)
  - A Level dropdown no longer appears on hover - button is completely disabled

- **Create Practice Pack page** (`/create-practice-pack`):
  - Subject dropdown displays all subjects but **only TSA is enabled** (BMAT is now greyed out as of Nov 2024)
  - Other subjects (English Lit, Maths, Chemistry, Biology, Interview, BMAT) are greyed out (opacity: 0.4, color: #999999)
  - Disabled subjects have cursor: not-allowed and cannot be selected

- **Select Practice Questions page** (`/select-practice-questions`):
  - Reduced padding between elements and navbar (main-content padding-top reduced from 88px to 63px for more compact layout)
  - Additional padding reductions for tighter spacing:
    - `.modal-container` padding: reduced from 12px 21px to 10px 18px
    - `.inner-container` padding: reduced from 17px to 12px
  - Fixed viewport scrolling: page container has fixed height and no scroll, only the questions container scrolls
  - Layout uses flexbox hierarchy to ensure questions container is scrollable while page remains fixed:
    - `.page-background`: height: 100vh, overflow: hidden
    - `.main-content`: height: calc(100vh - 63px), overflow: hidden
    - `.modal-container`: flex container with flex-direction: column, padding: 10px 18px
    - `.inner-container`: padding: 12px
    - `.questions-container`: flex: 1, min-height: 0, overflow-y: auto for scrollable content

## Spec Topic Page (Nov 2024)
- **New Page**: `/spec-topic` - "7.2 Differentiating Functions"
- **Purpose**: Dedicated topic page for specific spec point practice and learning

- **Page**: `/spec-point-session` - Individual spec point learning session
- **Loading States Fix** (Nov 2024):
  - Video and PDF loading states initialized to `true` (not `false`)
  - Ensures loading screens are visible on initial page render
  - Prevents flash of "no content" before data fetches
  - Loading states set to `false` after lesson data successfully loads
- **Layout Structure**:

  - Total flex ratio: 3:2 (main content : buddy chat)
- **Dynamic Title System** (Nov 2024):
  - Title format: "{specPoint} {specName}: Lesson {lessonNumber}"
  - Uses URL parameters: `?spec=X.X&lesson=N&name=TopicName`
  - Example: "1.1 Proofs: Lesson 1"
  - Chat welcome message also uses dynamic spec point info
  - **Implementation**: Uses `useSearchParams()` wrapped in Suspense boundary (Next.js 15 requirement)
- **Header**: Centered title display
  - Page title dynamically generated from URL parameters
  - No subtitle or bordered container
  - Clean, minimal presentation
- **Removed Elements** (Nov 2024):
  - Chat header: "Joe - Your Maths Buddy" and "Ask me anything about this spec point"

    - Counts unique correct answers from `learn_user_answers` table
    - Calculates total questions from loaded questions data
- **Database Query Fix** (Nov 2024):
  - **Issue**: Original code queried `learn_lessons` using non-existent `spec_point` column
  - **Solution**: Changed to direct lesson ID query instead
  - **Implementation**:
    - Hardcoded lesson ID: `d0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` (Power Rule lesson)
    - Query uses `.eq('id', lessonId)` instead of `.eq('spec_point', specPoint)`
    - Added join with `learn_spec_points` table to get spec point code and name
    - Questions already fetched correctly using `lesson_id`
  - **Database Schema Note**: `learn_lessons.spec_point_id` is a UUID foreign key, not a string column

## Lessons Questions API Route (Nov 2024)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/lessons/[lessonId]/questions` - GET endpoint for fetching lesson questions
- **File**: `app/api/lessons/[lessonId]/questions/route.ts`
- **Authentication**: No authentication required (content is public)
- **Parameters**:
  - `lessonId` (string, required): UUID of the lesson from learn_lessons table
- **Response Data**:
  - `success`: Boolean indicating success
  - `questions`: Array of question objects with nested parts (transformed to camelCase)
  - Each question has: `code`, `difficulty`, `instructions`, `parts[]`
  - Each part has: `id`, `letter`, `questionLatex`, `questionDisplay`, `solutionSteps`, `marks`
- **Database Query** (Updated Nov 2024):
  - **Single nested query** using Supabase relationship syntax for better performance
  - Fetches `learn_questions` with embedded `learn_question_parts` in one database call
  - Database fields: `question_code`, `difficulty_level`, `part_letter`, `question_latex`, `question_display`, `solution_steps`
  - **Data transformation**: Converts database snake_case fields to camelCase for frontend compatibility
  - Ordered by `display_order` for consistent presentation
  - Uses service role client (`@supabase/supabase-js`) matching project pattern
- **Error Handling**:
  - 400: Missing lesson ID
  - 500: Database error
  - Returns empty array if no questions found
- **Usage**: Used by spec point session pages to load practice questions

## Answer Submission API Route (Nov 2024)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/answers/submit` - POST endpoint for submitting and validating student answers
- **File**: `app/api/answers/submit/route.ts`
- **Dependencies**: Uses `mathjs` library for symbolic math comparison
- **Request Body**:
  - `user_id` (string, required): UUID of the user from auth.users
  - `question_part_id` (string, required): UUID of the question part from learn_question_parts
  - `submitted_answer_latex` (string, required): Student's LaTeX answer
  - `time_spent_seconds` (number, optional): Time spent on the question
- **Validation Logic**:
  - Fetches acceptable answers from `learn_question_parts.acceptable_answers` (JSON array)
  - **Normalization** applied to both submitted and acceptable answers:
    - Removes all whitespace
    - Converts `\times` and `\cdot` to `*`
    - Removes curly braces around single characters (e.g., `x^{6}` → `x^6`)
    - Converts `\div` to `/`
    - Lowercase conversion for case-insensitive comparison
  - **Two-stage comparison**:
    1. String matching on normalized LaTeX
    2. Symbolic math comparison using mathjs for algebraic equivalence
  - **Mathjs conversion**: Converts LaTeX to mathjs format (`\frac{a}{b}` → `(a)/(b)`, `\sqrt{x}` → `sqrt(x)`, etc.)
- **Database Operations**:
  - Saves to `learn_user_answers` table with fields:
    - `submitted_answer_latex`: Raw LaTeX answer
    - `is_correct`: Boolean validation result
    - `marks_awarded`: Full marks if correct, 0 if incorrect
    - `attempt_number`: Increments with each retry
    - `time_spent_seconds`: Time tracking
  - Database trigger automatically updates `learn_user_progress`

  - `correct` (boolean): Whether answer is correct
  - `correctAnswer` (string): First acceptable answer (for feedback)
  - `feedback` (string): User-friendly message
  - `marksAwarded` (number): Marks received
  - `attemptNumber` (number): Current attempt count
- **Error Handling**:
  - 400: Missing required fields
  - 404: Question part not found
  - 500: Database error or missing acceptable answers
  - Mathjs errors fall back to string comparison only
- **Usage**: Called from spec point session pages when students submit answers to practice questions

## PDF Viewer Component (Nov 2024)
- **Component**: `/components/PdfViewer.tsx` - Reusable PDF viewing component using react-pdf
- **Dependencies**: react-pdf library installed for PDF rendering
- **Props**:
  - `pdfUrl` (string, required): URL of the PDF to display
  - `onPageChange` (function, optional): Callback fired when page changes - receives page number
- **Features**:
  - **PDF Rendering**: Uses react-pdf's Document and Page components
  - **Navigation Controls**: Previous/Next buttons with proper disabled states
  - **Page Counter**: Displays "Page X of Y" format in center of controls

## Usage Tracking and Limits (Updated Nov 2024)
- **Monthly Cost Limits** (defined in `lib/usage-tracking.ts`):
  - Free tier: **$1.00** per month (reduced from $2.00)
  - Plus tier: $6.00 per month
  - Max tier: $12.00 per month

- **Important**: Limits are **COMBINED** for ALL services (AskBo, Interview prep, etc.) per user per month
  - Not separate limits per service
  - All AI interactions count toward the single monthly limit

- **Bug Fixes Applied** (Nov 2024):
  1. **Comparison operator consistency**: Changed from `>` to `>=` in `canMakeRequest()` to match `hasExceededLimit()`
  2. **Database error handling**: On errors, system now assumes limit is reached (conservative approach) instead of allowing unlimited usage
  3. **Race condition protection**: Added `verifyUsageWithinLimit()` function to detect when concurrent requests cause limit breach
     - API endpoints should call this function AFTER recording usage
     - Logs warning when overage is detected with exact overage amount

- **Key Functions**:
  - `canMakeRequest()`: Pre-flight check before allowing AI requests
  - `recordUsage()`: Records actual token usage after completion
  - `verifyUsageWithinLimit()`: Post-recording verification to catch race conditions
  - `getMonthlyUsage()`: Gets current month's total usage for a user

## Discord Ticket Enhancement (Updated Nov 2024)
- **Discord ID and Username in Tickets**: All Discord tickets now **require** user's Discord username
- **Implementation** (Updated Nov 2024):
  - Updated `/api/discord-webhook` to accept `discordId` and `discordUsername` parameters
  - Parameters are optional - won't break if not provided (backward compatible)
  - Added new "Discord Account" field in Discord embeds showing both username and ID
  - Format: `username (ID: discord_id)` or just `ID: discord_id` if username unavailable
- **Discord Username Requirement** (Updated Nov 2024):
  - **REQUIRED**: Discord username must be provided before ticket submission
  - If user profile doesn't have `discord_username`, a modal prompts user to enter it manually
  - Modal collects:
    - Discord Username (required) - e.g., "username" or "username#1234"
    - Discord ID (optional) - 18-digit number from Discord Developer Mode
  - Manual entry is stored in component state and used for ticket submission
  - Implementation in:
    - `components/ExamSearch/QuestionCard.tsx`: Shows Discord info modal before allowing answer submission
    - `app/askbo/page.tsx`: Shows Discord info modal before creating teacher help tickets
- **Database Backup** (Updated Nov 2024):
  - All tickets are now stored in the `support_tickets` database table as a backup
  - Stored information:
    - `user_id`: User's UUID from auth.users
    - `session_id`: Unique session UUID for tracking
    - `discord_username`: Discord username from profile or manual entry
    - `status`: Ticket status (default: 'open')
    - `notes`: JSON string containing ticket metadata (ticketId, type, userEmail, discordId, contentPreview)
  - Database insert is non-blocking - if it fails, the Discord ticket is still created
  - Both client components pass `userId` to the webhook API
  - Implementation in `app/api/discord-webhook/route.ts`
- **Affected Components**:
  - `components/ExamSearch/QuestionCard.tsx`:
    - Checks for Discord username before opening submission modal
    - Shows Discord info collection modal if username missing
    - Passes Discord info and userId when submitting answers
  - `app/askbo/page.tsx`:
    - Checks for Discord username before creating teacher tickets
    - Shows Discord info collection modal if username missing
    - Passes Discord info and userId when creating tickets
  - `app/api/discord-webhook/route.ts`:
    - Receives and includes Discord info in all ticket embeds
    - Stores ticket in support_tickets table as backup
- **Purpose**: Ensures teachers can always identify and contact students in Discord support channels, with database backup for tracking and analytics
