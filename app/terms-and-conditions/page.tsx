              <p><strong>2.1</strong> Subscriptions and one-off purchases should only be purchased by persons agreed 18 years old and over and the Services are intended for use by students under the supervision and account of their educational establishment or parents/legal guardians.</p>
              <p><strong>2.2</strong> Whilst the Supplier shall make reasonable efforts to provide guidance on the age appropriateness of the content and Services and to issue relevant warnings regarding any potentially sensitive themes or content, it remains the sole responsibility of the educational establishment or parents/legal guardian to determine the suitability of such content for students. Educational establishments and parents/legal guardians should review all content and Services provided to ensure they are suitable for the specific needs, age and sensitivities of their students and to guide and monitor students accordingly.</p>

              <p><strong>3.3</strong> In the case of multiple students (such as within an educational establishment), you must notify us promptly of any increase or decrease in the amount of students utilising the Services, so that we can accurately invoice you.

You pay us the interest together with any overdue amount.</p>
