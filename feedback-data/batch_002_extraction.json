    "statement_full_text": "Q1:\nMasada was where my fascination with the ancient world began, as the remains of the fortress revealed that Roman success rested on the principles of strategy rather than brute strength. This initial interest in ancient warfare led me to read 'The Roman Army at War' by Adrian Goldsworthy, where I learned how these principles manifested in discipline, organisation, and adaptability. What surprised me was how Roman strategy simultaneously enabled and constrained human improvisation: commanders followed a strict strategic framework, yet much of the success of the conquests depended on improvisation in response to unexpected developments. This combination of planning and flexibility worked to form a highly effective military. Through this, I came to understand that the Roman military is a reflection of Roman culture as a whole; a framework that balances structure with human judgement, which is evident in Roman institutions, law, and art. This insight inspired me to pursue classics more broadly, to learn about not only Greco-Roman social and political structures, but also their literature, philosophy, and art.\n\nQ2:\nMy favourite IB subject is philosophy. In my Extended Essay, I explored whether Act or Rule utilitarianism provides the better framework for balancing respect for sovereignty with the necessity of humanitarian intervention. I argued that Rule utilitarianism, due to its structured flexibility, offers a better framework, as it upholds sovereignty as a rule while allowing exceptions for the protection of human life. Engaging with the conflict between sovereignty and moral responsibility broadened my interest in philosophy and refined the analytical approach I now apply to classical texts. Whilst reading 'The Aeneid' by Virgil, its structural and thematic similarities to the Homeric epics intrigued me, which led me to enter St Hugh's Classical Reception Essay Competition. There, I argued that this resemblance is not evidence of superficial imitation by Virgil, but rather that they show a conscious reception of Homer; Virgil reworks the Homeric structure to convey Roman ideals, reshaping Homer's open-ended narratives into a teleological story driven by divine fate. My interest in history inspired me to enter the Robson History Essay Competition, in which I examined whether Justinian I ruined the Eastern Roman Empire. I disagreed with the premise, arguing that while his pursuit of reconquest, legal reform, and religious uniformity overstretched the state and laid the foundations for future instability, it did not ruin the empire outright. This led me to read Procopius' 'Wars', through which I learned how Roman culture and military evolved from the classical period onward. Building on my linguistic experience with English, German, and Hebrew, I began studying Latin, which allowed me to engage more effectively with texts during my research.\n\nQ3:\nTo implement theory in practice, I pursued an internship at the Israeli Antiquities Authority with Dr Guy Stiebel. I assisted with the cataloguing of artefacts from the Judean Desert, and engaged with significant discoveries such as the Dead Sea Scrolls. I also learned about emerging technologies, including imaging and AI tools that enable the deciphering of texts previously considered illegible. This demonstrated to me the extent to which classical scholarship is being transformed through modern technology. Alongside this work, I wrote a research paper that explored how AI is transforming the reconstruction of texts from the Herculaneum papyri. In the paper, I examined how specific innovations aid in the recovery of texts, while discussing select discoveries and considering the future role of digital tools in classical archaeology. As a member of the school's Scholars Debate club, I refined my ability to argue and evaluate evidence, further strengthening the critical skills I apply to classical research and solidifying my ambition to learn and contribute to the study of the classical world at university.",

    "statement_full_text": "When the future looks back on our society, they would find a world plagued by controversial wars like Vietnam, global pandemics and genocides - all informed by memorialisation connecting the past, present and future. As a member of the European Youth Parliament, I notice how politics breed insular thinking, which is one reason why state constructed memorials are often rhetorical and hyperbolic in nature to enforce one normative view despite the inherently subjective nature of public memory. Such findings prompted an exploration of memory studies, revealing their significance in shaping historiography and politics. A key controversy seen in the presidential proclamation delivered by President Johnson designating Sunday, November 28, 1965, as a day of prayer and 'remembrance' shows the legitimisation of a 'good' war, memorialising the war before it even ended. One specific part of the war, which the journalist Nick Turse makes the compelling argument in his book, 'Kill Anything That Moves,' said that the My Lai massacre was indeed an operation and not an aberration, challenging the honourable connotations of what a memorialisation ought to be.\n\nThis inspired further analysis in the article 'Commemorating A Difficult Past,' which convincingly argues that memorialisation is a political facade to hide the war's futility. However, Hagopian contents that oral narratives from ordinary people after the war holds a lot of authority, widening the diversity of how popular memory is discussed. Yet it became apparent that these narratives are sidelined due to popular Hollywood films and comic books about the war such as The 'Nam, which are extensions of political rhetoric. This showed me that generational opinion is preserved through entertainment legacy, laying the blueprint of how ideology is remembered. Honigsbaum also echoes this critique about the Covid-19 memorial in Embankment, noting that it was a symbol of the government's incompetent response to the pandemic. However, I took this further and argued that it was a distraction from the Partygate Scandal, using the guise of national solidarity to divert political humiliation. Still, regardless of how people see the government and its citizens inextricably, its political weight must not be mistaken as a microcosm of popular belief. This led to me looking at different mediums of sources to help gain a broader perspective. Using similar thinking, Larkin's article on the Rwanda commemoration argued that remembering needs to transcend politics. This way, stakeholders' stories can help protect historical truth from manipulation. Therefore, grassroot memorials from individualistic survivor testimonies is captivating. Delving deeper, the recent Gaza genocides is also problematic for future commemoration because it would be another symptom of geopolitical struggle. Would the erasure of Palestinian identity if Israel were to occupy Gaza hinder the former's ability to freely commemorate their beloved victims? For me, memorialisation in this case would be alike to Sri Lanka's hegemonic one, linking to McDowell's argument that memorialisation extends symbolic warfare. Yet, these narratives can only be useful as long as people choose to actively listen echoed by Murphy in her book 'You're Not Listening.' This is compelling because in the technological zeitgeist, people's ability to communicate and develop feeling is limited, enabling moral traumas to persist. Therefore, memorialisation is on the surface used by the state to enforce popular collective memory, but this is the very reason why they are narrow and empty in scope because they are just political. Studying history is not simply retrospection, but inform dynamics between different demographics and strata, shaping the present and the future.\n\nI attended a lecture called 'Don't Worry Mum…We Got Penicillin' in attempt to balance out the androcentric memory of the war, but to my dismay, the resources used in this lecture were incredibly male dominated. As a result, I realised that by centralising marginalised voices in historical discourse, can improve the diversity in how collective memory is studied and how politics is perceived. A thought I had after attending the Balfour project about the Palestine-Israel conflict was that apolitical education can help suppress generational hostility and minimise radical ideologies from being inherited by children, limiting conflicts. Moreover, by participating in the John Locke essay competition, enabled me to think more divergently and helped me to synthesise my arguments, which is useful for reading history at university.",

    "statement_full_text": "I am interested in applying moral reasoning to complex circumstances through law, particularly Tort Law. Reading Holtby v Brigham & Cowan 2000 exposed me to the difficulty of apportioning liability fairly in cases of cumulative harm. The Court of Appeal held Brigham & Cowan liable for 75% of the damage based on their contribution to the claimant's asbestosis, which recognised that, while extent of causation was uncertain, expert testimony stated Holtby would have less severe asbestosis but for working at Brigham. This change to the \"but for\" test, in which Brigham recognised unnecessary causes, led me to read Stapleton's 'Unnecessary and Insufficient Factual Causes', which argues that causation law should recognise causes that are neither necessary nor sufficient for an outcome, in cases of divisible and indivisible harm. I found this persuasive given Holtby's precedent, especially as use of her extended 'but for' test would lead to a similar judgement in Holtby. A mechanical approach to legal causation is similarly scrutinised in R v Hughes 2011, where the UKSC held that the 'but for' test fails to distinguish between sufficient and merely necessary causes. This deepened my appreciation of the law's reliance on careful, context-sensitive reasoning, and I am excited to further explore legal interpretation.\n\nIntrigued by the UK's refusal to extradite individuals to jurisdictions that use the death penalty, I explored the topic in a school research project, which examined the legal tensions between international cooperation and human rights protection. Since the UK cannot derogate from the ECHR, its ability to cooperate with other states is limited when inhumane treatment is at risk. In Soering v United Kingdom 1989, the ECtHR held that extraditing a person to face death row breaches Article 3. The legal privilege of human rights over diplomatic relations also extends to intelligence-sharing: in Elgizouli v Secretary of State 2020, the UKSC ruled that providing evidence to the US without a full death penalty assurance was unlawful. These rulings reflect a shift towards a hierarchy of obligations, explored by Dugard and Van den Wyngaert's Reconciling Extradition with Human Rights. I found that the 'two tier system' they identify, where human rights, and thereby dignity, take precedence over other treaty commitments, makes the maintenance of diplomatic relations a secondary objective of the state without 'rupture' to the international community, as Lady Hale described. This deepened my interest in how legal reasoning can resolve conflicts between competing principles.\n\nObserving civil cases during my work experience at 33 Bedford Row revealed the challenge civil courts face in administering justice while recognising complexities in individual cases. Family law epitomises this, especially In re B (A Child) 2009, where the biological father sought a residence order for H, who had always lived with his grandmother. The Family Division of the High Court initially allowed the parent's appeal, arguing that, if a child's biological father provides 'good enough' care, the grandmother's potentially improved standard of care need not be considered. This overlooks that H's emotional attachment to his grandmother is key to his 'best interests', and omits that 'second best' is not enough in residence decisions, as the UKSC pointed out. The UKSC's restoration of the Family Court ruling affirmed that the standard of 'best interest' is not fixed but contextual. Though it relates to adoption, not residency, Re W [A child] 2016 EWCA Civ 793 similarly upheld that a child's welfare cannot be reduced to biological ties. I explored how the Welfare Checklist under the Children Act 1989 reflects this, as it considers the capabilities of other relevant people alongside the child's parents in determining \"best interest\". This developed my interest in legal progress, which I hope to explore further in my Undergraduate Studies.",

    "statement_full_text": "Part 1\nMy curiosity for science was ignited from a young age by the 'I Wonder Why' book series that answered all the questions I had about how the human body works. This early exposure fostered my lifelong passion for Biology and set me on a path toward pursuing a career in the field. In my recent explorations, a procedure called faecal microbiota transplantation intrigued me, which was introduced to me by the Netflix documentary 'Hack Your Health: The Secrets of Your Gut'. In the documentary, a patient with irritable bowel syndrome received a faecal transplant from a donor. While it alleviated her gut issues, it also led to unintended side effects similar to her donor's pre-existing conditions, and one of them being symptoms of depression. This prompted me to question: how can mental health possibly be affected by gut health?\n\nFollowing that, I delved into articles and videos about the gut-brain axis and how the enteric nervous system and central nervous system affect one another. In this context, I am amazed by how gut microbiota, gut cells and the brain are all interconnected. Gut microbiota communicates with the brain via gut-derived molecules that act on the vagus nerve or directly through microbe-generated signals. It is possible that the gut bacteria the patient ingested contained microbial components that triggered inflammation, affecting enterochromaffin cells in the intestinal epithelial lining and disrupting serotonin synthesis in her body. This in all probability altered the brain neurotransmitter systems and exacerbated depression, which was why she experienced symptoms of depression similar to those of her donor. This interplay of cellular communication piqued my interest in Cell Biology, in that it links the seemingly simple process of gut health to more complex behaviours like mental health. Furthermore, it made me question whether cellular disruptions in the gut could be one of the contributing factors to the decline in mental health among young adults. Could this connection also be reflected in the rising rates of colorectal cancer among the same age group? Understanding how cells interact within systems is a key driver behind my passion for Cell Biology because countless processes in the body that affect overall health are built on these interactions. I also believe that studying these connections could pave the way for identifying early signs of diseases and coming up with targeted interventions to combat them.\n\nPart 2\nThrough my volunteer work with Zooniverse, I engaged with crowdsourced research to help identify mitochondria in placenta profiles, which gave me a glimpse into the meticulous yet vital steps of research. I have also participated in the Malaysia National Chemistry Quiz twice, in 2022 and 2024, which strengthened my knowledge in a subject that is crucial for my course. In addition, I volunteered to visit the operating theatres at a hospital for World Anaesthesia Day, where I had the opportunity to observe a fibroadenoma excision surgical procedure firsthand. Witnessing the interplay between science and healthcare made me realise the importance of how cellular processes underpin medical progress and has therefore reinforced my commitment to study Cellular Biology with the hopes of contributing to breakthroughs that could lead to better treatments in the future.\n\nPart 3\nI am unsure of what to write for this section, I'd appreciate your advice! Should I write about my super curriculars that are not related to my field of study here?",

Being captivated into reading the Global Financial Stability report, and how it points out that while rapid financial stability risks are composed, heightened weaknesses continue to pose risks of future casualties in the economy. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the figures for growing financial instability have escalated drastically. This threatens the macroeconomic stability, leading to it shifting, and making it vulnerable to a severe global crisis, effecting GDP growth. This lead me to take part in the young enterprise competition, where I pitched a product that I created alongside with my group, leading me to discover the great potential i hold for pursuing my future aspirations in finance. Morgan Stanley's documentary, \"Our History,\" especially Episode 4, exhibits the maturity and decline of financial markets in great detail. It further displays the establishment's greatest loss of $9.4 billion, and how they managed their greatest economic downfall. It shows how one trade could wipe out a third of their revenue, showing the significance of financial stability, showing me how the economy stays afloat.\n\nMy studies in Business has given me a strong understanding in how financial decisions plays a key role in the way a business is shaped. I was particularly intrigued by topics like budgeting, investment, and financial planning, which sparked my curiosity into accounting and finance. This led me to take part in the Aon Insight Programme, where we worked in teams as ESG investment consultants. Our task was to build investment strategies while considering social, environmental, and governance factors that could create a sustainable Halo City. This has helped me understand how long term financial decisions are made. We presented our proposition to the Aon's board panel, and I was proud to be awarded Best presentation, it was an experience that strengthened my teamwork and communication skills, while creating lots of great connections I can cherish. Studying Psychology alongside Business has allowed me to analyse different client perspectives and maintain a strong client relationship. I've learnt the importance to actively listen and understand people. The combination of both subjects have matured my analytical and critical thinking skills. After strengthening my curiosity by gaining practical experience, I have guaranteed studying accounting and finance would allow me to build core values to build on my weaknesses.\n\nThe Aon insight programme has provided me with a rounded view of what goes on behind the scenes into creating the foundation of a business. The highlight of my experience was exploring financial services into cybersecurity, which showed how to perfect a business's transparency for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial information. My skills in perseverance and organisation comes from being a current volunteer at Diabetes UK. Having a parent who is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I grew a deep attachment to spreading awareness. which lead me to volunteering with the NHS eye screening team, therefore pairing my passion to connect with clients and understand their needs on a personal level. My 3 years experience of playing the violin shows my consistency and ability to execute long term objectives and struggles. Displaying my skills in events like parents evening and Christmas fair's for an elderly care home, as well as peer tutoring year 11 students, to drive them for success. My experiences have led me to grow long-term ambitions to pursue my competitive nature in finance. My time at a local accountancy educated me on financial statements and invoices, leading to me becoming curious of how clients put trust in accountants to ensure financial security, emphasising on the importance of strong client relationships and networking.",
