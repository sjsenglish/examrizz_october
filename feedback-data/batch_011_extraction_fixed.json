    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nI want to study Economics because I am eager to understand the deeper reasons behind economic distribution and wealth inequality. Growing up witnessing poverty around me, I came to notice that the fundamentals underpinning our economy were broken. With the escalating cost-of-living crisis driving more families into deprivation, I was left to ask: \"If money can be created so easily, why does poverty still exist?\". This led me to question the role of debt in shaping the economy.\n\nI explored this further during a work experience placement at the Bank of England, where I was appointed Deputy Lead on a group project on fiat and commodity money. I was fascinated to learn how excessive debt contributed to the housing bubble in 2008, putting many working-class families at risk of financial hardship. This transition to more credit-based economies, resulting from the monetarist policies of the 2000s that dominated in the UK and US, has developed into structures that allow individuals with more resources to accumulate wealth at the expense of those lower down the economic hierarchy. This felt critical to me â€“ the shift from a labour-based economy to one with intensifying rentier capitalism was a key factor driving prices of basic goods up, causing families to rely on food banks.\n\nIt is this interdisciplinary nature that draws me to the subject, as I aspire to better understand the issues around economic disparity. Uncovering the challenges working-class families face across the world motivates me to study the subject at a deeper level.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nStudying A Level Economics introduced me to the impacts of financialisation, particularly how it can withhold wealth from the productive economy, marginalising the working class.\n\nThomas Piketty's work on wealth concentration showed me how, without progressive wealth taxation, extreme wealth appropriation can worsen inequality and restrict the government's fiscal scope. This means appropriation may push governments to rely on a monetary policy such as quantitative easing to stimulate demand. Overreliance often inflates assets and living costs, ultimately deepening the cost-of-living crisis. This led me to discover \"Fictitious Capital\". Reading this alongside my studies shaped my view that rentier capitalism drives up the value of assets such as housing and land, making them increasingly inaccessible to families. It was particularly saddening to learn that many young adults may not be able to afford their own home, and it made me recognise the need for progressive taxation on assets, rather than just income.\n\nReading \"Why Nations Fail\" challenged me to think more critically about the role of governments. While the authors argue that inclusive institutions reduce inequality, I found that both inclusive and extractive bodies can foster exploitative rentier capitalism and hinder the reach of working-class families. Taken together, these readings further motivated me to advance my understanding of wealth inequality at a societal level.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences helpful?\n\nTo learn more, I attended a work experience placement at the HM Treasury, where I explored how the government is supporting deprived areas in Britain. I was astonished to learn of the positive impact the Darlington Economic Centre has on the town's deprivation, which introduced opportunities and businesses to the North rather than concentrating them in London. Bringing corporations and jobs into the North is crucial in closing the rural divide.\n\nWithin my work experience, I presented an idea around a major national policy change, which led me to consider the design of parking fines. While these fines are meant to induce behavioural change, they have a disproportional impact on the working-class while having little impact on the wealthy. Researching Finland's day fine system, where penalties are proportional to income, showed me how fines could help tackle growing wealth inequality in the UK.\n\nTo stay informed on the state of the global economy, I regularly read The Economist's Espresso and The New York Times. In addition, my involvement in the Student Union has developed my communication and leadership skills as I contributed to the creation of societies and took part in weekly meetings.\n\nExtension [1200 Characters]\n\nI applied for Land Economy at Cambridge as I would like to explore the complexities of urban economics, which is largely not covered in my A levels. I gained this interest after attending a Masterclass, where I explored how legal and institutional frameworks shape policy outcomes in housing and the socio-economic consequences that follow as a result.\n\nThis inspired me to develop a 2D-city building simulation for my Computer Science NEA, illustrating how zoning choices influence GDP, population growth, and happiness. Creating this project showed me how cities must be carefully designed to meet the needs of their residents, growing my passion for urban economics.\n\nI am also drawn to Cambridge's supervision system, as I have always found teaching in small groups more impactful, allowing learning to be closely directed to my own problems and questions. To me, there is a real importance of interacting with peers who share the same ideas and others who hold different perspectives.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nThe integration of economic theory with historical contexts has provided a quantitative and qualitative lens of the progress of global economic history and development. This approach excites me since it offers a holistic understanding of the uncertainties of the past in their own right, as well as aiding economic policy and management decisions for the issues we face today.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nAs cofounder of the Economics Society, I led research on a group entry to Discover Economics' essay competition in which I explored the drivers of UK wealth inequality and ways they can be addressed. We concluded that unequal opportunities to asset ownership, regional investment and financial literacy is the driver. We honed in on the failure of the Right to Buy Scheme and unequal regional benefits of globalisation to explain how unequal access to the property ladder and post-industrial regions' structural decline has driven UK wealth inequality. Amongst policies like wealth and exodus taxes, we suggested that investment in education and financial literacy in deprived areas is pivotal to improving wealth inequality and economic development. Thus, when reading 'Global Economic History' (R.C. Allen) I agreed that the use of universal education was the most effective 'standard model' development strategy that helped Northwestern Europe and the USA catch up to Britain's industrial comparative advantage. In 'The Bottom Billion' (Collier), I concur with the view that the poorest countries require more than just simple international aid to escape the poverty trap. Instead, targeted aid,peacekeeping and investment are necessary. Allen also voiced how investment banks providing firms with capital was another standard model strategy for industrial development. This inspired me to research more into the role of investment banks and analyse whether the deregulation of such financial institutions in the 1980s led to the 2008 financial crisis. The article 'Reagan Did it' (P.Krugman) explored the notion that the incentive for high risks by deregulating was to blame for 2008. This clarified to me that 1980s neoliberal reform left economies vulnerable. My CISI exams motivate me to explore financial regulation and ethics. In 'Can there be another Crash?', Heller examined causes of the Great Depression and compared them with the economic climate of the late 1970s. Whilst he incorrectly concluded that another crash was unlikely, I appreciated that Heller was taking a historical perspective on the study of economics and making future predictions. However, this presented me with the danger that making too many parallels with the present when analysing the past can lead to inaccuracies. Economic history should be analysed to understand past economic phenomena, not solely to predict the future. I was thus prompted to attend an LSE economic history lecture on the convergent evolution of monetary systems. I was fascinated by the process by which Germany formed its first common currency - proven necessary due to Gresham's Law ('bad money' drove out 'good money' - Kreuzers).\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nIn a Balliol College tutorial, I applied game theory strategies in problem-solving exercises and in a QMUL taster I explored how mathematics like calculus can be applied to economics through utility functions. This furthered my motivation to study economics through a quantitative and qualitative lens. 'Factfulness' (Rosling) challenged my personal biases and refined my data interpretation. I enjoyed its criticism of sensationalism and promotion of a fact based world view, though I question how some negative trend topics like ecological sustainability were refrained from. During my F1 work experience, I took on the role of all executive business roles. This made me reflect on a sustainable operations lecture, which emphasised the need for constant consideration of ESG goals when making decisions like where the next Grand Prix should be. Overall, these experiences have shaped my desire to study degree level economics.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nThe integration of economic theory with historical contexts has provided a quantitative and qualitative lens on global economic progress and phenomena. As cofounder of the Economics Society, I delivered a presentation on financial institutions and this sparked my interest in researching the role of investment banks in the global economy. The article 'Reagan Did it' (P.Krugman) explored the notion that the incentive for high risks by deregulating was to blame for the 2008 Financial Crisis. This clarified to me that 1980s neoliberal reform left economies vulnerable. Thus, I believe that we must tightly regulate financial services (including shadow banking, credit raters and new fintech firms) to mitigate risk of financial sector induced global recessions. My CISI exams motivate me to explore financial regulation and ethics further. In 'Can there be another Crash?', Heller examines Great Depression causes in comparison with the economic climate of the late 1970s. Whilst he incorrectly concluded that another big crash was unlikely, I appreciated that Heller was taking a historical perspective on the study of economics and making future predictions. However, this presented me with the danger that making too many parallels with the present when analysing the past can lead to inaccuracies. Economic history should be analysed to understand past economic phenomena, not solely to predict the future. Using Cauchy distributions would be more appropriate for financial market predictions. In a Balliol College tutorial, I applied game theory strategies to pay-off matrices, applying interdependent decision making e.g between oligopolistic banks. Then, I explored utility functions and calculus. This furthered my motivation to study economics through a quantitative and qualitative lens.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nIn my Discover Economics' essay competition, I explored the different drivers of persistent wealth inequality in the UK and the ways they can be addressed; I found the drivers to be unequal opportunities to: asset ownership, regional investment and financial literacy. I honed in on the failure of the Right to Buy Scheme to explain how unequal access to the property ladder has driven UK wealth inequality. It turned public assets into appreciating private wealth. Though, due to uneven regional benefits of globalisation like FDI there were disparities in appreciation. My calculations of house prices in the South growing by 1100% more than houses in the North showed to me the importance of that investment, especially considering post-industrial regions' structural decline. Analysing these statistics and Lorenz curves informed my conclusion. Amongst policies like wealth and exodus taxes, I argued that investment in education and financial literacy in deprived areas is pivotal to improving wealth inequality and lead to economic growth. This was inspired by R.C. Allen in 'Global Economic History' where I agreed that the use of universal education was the most effective 'standard model' development strategy that helped Northwestern Europe and the USA catch up to Britain's industrial comparative advantage. I believe that improving human capital is a development strategy that stands the test of time. Exploration of globalisation prompted me to attend an LSE economic history lecture on the convergent evolution of monetary systems. It made me wonder whether the rise of cryptocurrencies represents a modern form of evolutionary monetary convergence. Moreover, I was fascinated by the process by which Germany formed its first common currency union- proven necessary due to Gresham's Law ('bad money' drove out 'good money').\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nDuring my F1 work experience, I took on the role of all executive business roles. This made me reflect on a sustainable operations lecture, which emphasised the need for constant consideration of ESG goals when making decisions like where the next Grand Prix should be. Overall, these experiences have shaped my readiness for undergraduate level economics.",

How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nReading an article on Trump's proposal to deregulate control emissions, after removing the US from the Paris Agreement, led me to question who bears the cost of such decisions. This inspired me to attend a lecture on 'Geopolitics of Climate Change', which introduced me to climate migration as an inevitable result of climate change. While relocating communities vulnerable to climate change may be considered an economically viable adaptation strategy, I believe it is inequitable and more must be done to reduce global emissions. Watching the documentary Anote's Ark reinforced this view, as I reflected on how small islands like Kiribati contribute negligibly to emissions yet face existential threats- a stark example of climate injustice. Seeking solutions, I entered the Financial Times essay competition, where I explored market-based instruments in controlling pollution. I found that well-enforced tradable pollution permits can be efficient, offering incentives to adopt green technology without burdening firms' costs. The EU ETS has been a success but needs global commitment to prevent carbon leakages.\n\nAfter reading 'Rethinking the Economics of Land and Housing' by Collins, I learnt how land value largely accounts for exorbitant house prices in London. I was intrigued by the critique of neoclassical economics for conflating land with capital, despite its fixed supply and inability to respond to demand except through rising prices. To delve deeper, I attended a lecture 'Exploring Residential Property Markets', learning more about house price determinants. As I was posed with the question of how a new metro affects house/rent prices, I connected Ricardo's theory of economic rent- land values rise not only from the landowner's efforts, but from surrounding investment leading to higher rents. My growing interest in housing led me to explore solutions to the Hong Kong housing crisis in my EPQ. I learnt how government land auctions inflate scarce land prices as a main source of government revenue. While recognising the fiscal need, I argued it should not outweigh adequate and affordable housing provision. I concluded that adaptive reuse of vacant industrial buildings- feasible given Hong Kong's post-1980s manufacturing decline- provides immediate relief with land reclamation to increase developable land. Drawing on Collin's view of land as a financial asset, I believe these measures must be coupled with vacancy taxes to curb speculation and ensure housing serves as shelter. Moreover, I explored a YouTube series using multivariate regression in hedonic pricing to assess how factors such as pollution influence property values. Studying Maths deepened my appreciation for statistical modelling as a tool to uncover what people value most in a home.\n\n3. What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nIn the Green Schools Challenge I was project lead, developing NoteCycle, a digital solution to reduce paper use and promote sustainability. Placing 2nd and presenting to businesses honed my public speaking. I am the youngest member of my Parish Council's editorial team, where I contribute to meetings and write articles on local development, including housing, published to 3000 homes. Witnessing our magazine foster local business growth and build a sense of place, fascinates me to explore regional development further at university. I am also fundraising to volunteer in South Africa next summer, eager to broaden my understanding of addressing inequality.",

    "statement_full_text": "1. Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nGrowing up in a small town, I have always viewed cities as areas of success and opportunity. Intrigued if this perception was true, I turned to Glaeser's book 'Triumph of the City', where I was captivated by the story of Detroit's decline revealing that not all cities emulate this ideal. I reflected on how clustering of firms can drive innovation and economic growth, and think the most important agglomeration economies for Detroit are knowledge spillovers. Detroit's decline was multilayered, but I believe its main weakness was its inability to address the diminishing human capital that automotive assembly line production created, by reducing the need for cities to spread knowledge. This piqued my interest in urban economics and led me to dedicate my NEA on how the quality of life differs between two estates in Milton Keynes. I explored wealth distribution, using Spearman's rank to test the association between house prices and house area, and discovered that Beanhill had substantially cheaper housing than Shenley Church End. Beanhill was a centre of extreme deprivation, allowing me to see parallels with Glaeser's argument that cheap housing often attracts the poor. The desire to understand how urban growth interacts with the housing market motivates me to study Geography and Economics.\n\n2. How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nAfter reading 'Rethinking the Economics of Land and Housing' by Collins, I learnt how land value largely accounts for exorbitant house prices. I was intrigued by the critique of neoclassical economics for conflating land with capital, despite its fixed supply and inability to respond to demand except through rising prices. To delve deeper, I attended a lecture by the University of Cambridge 'Exploring Residential Property Markets', where I learnt more about determinants of house prices. As I was posed with the question of how a new metro affects house or rent prices, I connected Ricardo and Smith's theory of economic rent - land values rise not only from the landowner's efforts, but from surrounding investment leading to higher rents. My growing interest in housing led me to explore solutions to the Hong Kong housing crisis in my EPQ. I reflected on how government land auctions inflate scarce land prices as a main source of government revenue. While recognising the fiscal need, I argued it should not outweigh adequate and affordable housing provision. I concluded that adaptive reuse of vacant industrial buildings, feasible given Hong Kong's post-1980s manufacturing decline, provides immediate relief with land reclamation to increase developable land. Drawing on Collin's view of land as a financial asset, I believe these measures must be coupled with vacancy taxes to curb speculation and ensure housing serves as shelter.\n\nVisiting my grandad who farmed the land in Kalampatti, a small village in India, I became aware of how closely people's livelihoods depend on the natural environment. This inspired me to watch Sukhdev's TED Talk 'Put a Value on Nature', where I discovered that the world is irretrievably losing natural capital at a rapid rate of $2-4 trillion annually due to the economic invisibility of nature. To explore how to address this, I attended a lecture by the University of Cambridge on 'Valuing Nature: Why and How?', where I learnt about how non-market valuation methods can incentivise conserving nature by assigning a monetary value for ecosystem services. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1998 is an example of how contingent valuation was used to assess the American public's willingness to pay to prevent another similar accident. However, I believe the value produced is not fully reliable, since contingent valuation introduces hypothetical bias as actual payments may differ from stated ones. I found revealed preference methods, such as replacement cost, more convincing, as they monetise ecosystem services by using real market behaviour through equating them with the manual cost that farmers like my grandad would otherwise incur for processes like pollination. Therefore, I think valuation is most useful when applied pragmatically in public spending decisions, as recognised in the UK's Green Book for cost-benefit analysis to ensure natural capital is accounted for.\n\n3. What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nBeyond studies, I led my team in the Green Schools Challenge, where we placed 2nd with our proposal of NoteCycle, a digital solution to target excessive paper use and promote sustainability. Being the youngest member of my Parish Council's editorial team, I write articles that are published to 3000 homes and contribute to discussions about the development of our community. Engaging with different perspectives on issues such as housing has taught me to consider multiple stakeholders when evaluating policies at the intersection of Geography and Economics.",
