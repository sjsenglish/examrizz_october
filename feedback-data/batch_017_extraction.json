    "statement_full_text": "Personal Statement for Economics (maybe econ and phil)\nWhy do you want to study this course or subject?Bottom of Form\nI first realised the concept of trading time for money when my family acquired a small business – I noticed the difference between labour and capital, and the emphasis on building assets that generate income irrespective of hours worked, which shifted us to financial stability. I reflected on the value of money and how economic choices affect the quality of life.\n Travelling between my family's roots in China and the US exposed me to distinct contrasts between developing and advanced economies. I was curious to how cities develop to global economic centres and where wealth originates: Why did Shanghai's trajectory diverge from Beijing's? Why did the cost of dragon fruit in Toronto and Manchester differ so vastly? I concluded that the answers lay not in geography, but in complex systems of supply chains, policy, and global trade.\nTo explore this further, I completed Oxford's PPE insight on Springpod, exploring how policy, philosophy, and geography shape economic outcomes. Charles Tilly's idea 'the state made the war, and the war made the state' fascinated me by the effects of conflict and grew my interest in how various states developed. \nReading 'Can't we just print more money?' framed economics as the study of choices. I discovered that my own mindset was inherently economic. My decision to stay at my school for sixth form despite rational instincts to leave, highlighted the tension between logical cost-benefit analysis and irrational human biases. It illustrates how human behaviour deviates from pure rationality often to the choice that proves makes us happiest, as explored in Dan Ariely's talk, 'are we in control of our own decisions?'. \nSheremeta's TED talk 'The pursuit of happiness' showed that while income raises happiness, it plateaus. Money buys comfort, not fulfilment, and does so at the cost of our most finite resource: time. Personally, running our restaurant increased income but reduced time together. Professor Jiang's lecture 'Consumerism is the perfection of slavery' made me question whether modern economies encourage endless consumption and labour at the cost of genuine happiness. I saw the parallels, how social comparisons drive consumer choices, just as competition over resources drives national conflicts. I pondered the structure of our labour market, consumerism, and trade-offs we make chasing financial stability. Whether modern consumer capitalism truly enables a good life, or if wealth truly substitutes for time. Our lives are structured around earning, consuming and competing. We are conditioned to believe that life should revolve around making money, as though wealth is the ultimate source of happiness. It seems that money is an invisible trap, necessary for survival, yet in pursuing it, capable of consuming our time, relationships and individuality.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nFrom enjoying calculus in A level maths, and analysing the choices of my family, I modelled a production function to quantify the relationship between labour input and output. Using calculus, I derived the marginal product of labour, formalising the law of diminishing returns we experienced: each additional hour worked brought smaller gains in income at a greater cost to wellbeing. This application of mathematics to a personal economic problem solidified my desire to learn the formal econometric tools needed to measure such trade-offs on a larger scale. \nWhat else have you done outside your education and Why are these experiences useful?\nCurious about the choices of consumers, I researched the global spike in demand for matcha. I observed a cherished part of my heritage become a commodified trend, prioritising aesthetics over authenticity. Managing marketing for businesses showed me how digital platforms shape consumer behaviour; now I saw them reshape a global market. A drink once dismissed as tasting like grass, became desirable through social influence. Businesses capitalised on this trend with inferior matcha at inflated prices for profit. The demand created shortages and pressured farmers, rooted not in genuine appreciation, but in social media-amplified herd behaviour. This phenomenon highlights the tension between authenticity and profit, tradition, and trend, showing that economics is not just abstract supply and demand, but the study of how technology and consumerism drive markets and reshape value itself. \nWorking in my family's restaurant, from waitressing to bookkeeping has further shown me how these economics principles operate in real-world businesses. I began to see each business as a mini economy. By its internal ecosystem, from kitchen staff to online ordering platforms. Supply and demand dictated operations, strategic decisions mirrored game theory. Shadowing at my mother's salon showed how customer experience influenced demand. To broaden my perspective, I completed Springpod work experience with Heathrow Airport and Barclays, gaining insight into organisational strategy and large-scale financial systems.\n\nAbove all, my years at a specialist music boarding school from the age of eight taught me to recognise opportunity cost and trade-offs in a very practical sense, while also allowing me to develop my own human capital through intensive training in music.\nBalancing a demanding schedule of academics simultaneously with music developed strong time management and perseverance. Studying violin in a pressured environment required hours of practice and rehearsals, where I built concentration and teamwork. Completing both my Music GCSE and A-level a year early proves my resilience. \nAs a String and Junior House prefect, it is rewarding to apply the skills I learnt growing up in order to support younger students and transfer my discipline into guidance. Through organising events and supporting younger students from my roles, I have practised my organisational, communication, and leadership skills. Beyond my A levels, I am currently studying AmusTCL, which has navigated me to independently research and study set works, therefore giving me an insight to the levels of study required at university.  \nThese experiences have shaped my interest in how incentives, efficiency, and choices influence behaviour, businesses, and economic issues. I am excited to deepen this understanding by studying economics at university, combining theory with quantitative analysis, to better explain the systems that affect society.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why Do You Want To Study This Course/Subject?\nDuring a greyhound dental procedure at a small animal hospital, I saw how untreated periodontal disease can cause lasting pain and wider health problems. Looking beyond immediate treatment, I the vet highlighted the impact that preventative care could have in sparing an animal years of discomfort. I noticed how vets often consulted textbooks, as every animal presents as an individual case; sometimes with symptoms rather than a clear disease; which showed me the profession relies on weighing evidence to reach the best decision. After this placement, I was offered a Saturday job at the clinic, where I had to maintain a sterile environment to protect patients and staff. At a large animal practice, I applied the same preventative principles whilst I administered bluetongue vaccinations, disinfecting equipment and changing gloves between animals. This multifaceted nature of veterinary medicine excites me as it allows me to indulge into practical skills, scientific depth and responsibilty simultaneously.\n\nHow Have Your Qualifications and Studies Helped You To Prepare For This Course Or Subject?\nWhile on a placement in a large animal clinic in Germany, I saw the effects of intensive production when a bull developed rumen bloat after a switch to a high-concentrate diet to improve meat quality. After the vet inserted a trocar and cannula, I injected an anti-inflammatory and antibiotics, appreciating the responsibility. I later read Yusu Wang's journal on feedlot bloat pathogenesis, comparing the free gas and foam formation theories. I found evidence supporting the latter theory to be more convincing as the rumen fistulated goat experiment provided visual evidence of foam production rather than free gas. In contrast, I thought the gas overproduction theory lacked direct experimental support and relied on assumptions about why normal eructation would fail to remove excess gas which seemed less conclusive to me. This sparked my interest in biotechnology's role in balancing productivity with welfare. I received \"highly commended\" being one if the top 10 entries to the Minds Underground Veterinary essay competition where I explored reproductive technologies and gene editing. Learning about induced pluripotent cells led me to Jonathan Slack's \"A Short Introduction to Stem Cells\"...\n\nWhat Else Have You Done To Prepare Outside of Education, and Why Are These Experiences Useful?\nAt a veterinary masterclass I attended, a vet's account of dehorning rhinos highlighted the importance of focusing efforts for maximum impact, an idea echoed in the \"Biology for a Better Tomorrow\" course by Leaf that I completed. This course introduced me to AI's potential in medicine but lacked detail on drug development, hence I watched a TEDx talk on how AI accelerated COVID-19 clinical trials by improving site selection and patient recruitment. However, a VetTimes podcast on rising anti microbial resistance causing a rise of bovine respiratory issues led me to consider the prospect of AI-driven treatments. I then learned from a Nature article how AI and compound screening are being used to develop antibiotic potentiators, which could enhance existing antibiotics and protect animal health. During a Cambridge vet residential, I practised feeling inside a model cow's rectum and removed nails from a model horse's shoe, reinforcing my desire to combine scientific principles with practical skills. This led me to volunteer at a stable for my Gold DofE, gaining confidence with horses through feeding, grooming, and exercising them. Furthermore, I spent a summer working at a livery stable, where I enhanced my practical skills in animal care and developed my communication skills by regularly interacting with clients. During a consultation, I saw a vet compassionately discussing treatment costs and euthanasia with a client whose dog had many issues including epilepsy. This demonstrated the importance of empathetic communication to help clients navigate emotionally and financially difficult decisions, whilst ensuring they feel informed and supported. I am drawn to veterinary medicine because it's multifaceted nature let's me combine scientific depth, practical skill and responsibility for animal welfare.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1:\nA field trip to the UNDP in Georgia revealed how political systems shape development and the lives of citizens. Observing how governments in the Global South navigate within the fabric of international politics sparked my interest in the balance between governance and development and the complexity of such relationships.\n\nThis curiosity deepened when I founded a competitive debate club, exploring contested issues in depth and developing my analytical skills. One topic that proved pivotal was the effectiveness of international aid in promoting sustainable development. Initially, I believed aid could directly stimulate economic growth and social progress. However, after reading Globalization and Its Discontents by Joseph Stiglitz, I came to appreciate that development outcomes are rarely linear. His analysis of how international institutions shape economic policy to pursue their own goals highlighted the limits of aid. It made me realise that the political decisions of all actors shape the success of development initiatives and external aid, if mismanaged, can exacerbate existing crises.\n\nThis shift in perspective enhanced my understanding of the interplay between political authority and economic policy. Engaging with these ideas consolidated my interest in how governments and IGOs shape equitable and sustainable development, and motivates me to investigate these questions further through degree-level study.\n\nQuestion 2:\nIn my IB Global Politics unit on development, I explored concepts including institutional capacity and its role in shaping development outcomes. Studying how political institutions' transparency, accountability, and effectiveness influence policy implementation allowed me to critically examine why similar development initiatives can produce very different results in different contexts.\n\nAlongside this, I engaged with regenerative approaches to development, a critical perspective on sustainability. Although these strategies are often presented as universally beneficial, it is clear that the countries which stand to benefit are developing states lacking the resources or technology to implement them effectively. Achieving meaningful progress would rely on a form of liberalism whereby wealthier states provide support without imposing restrictive conditions, which is challenging in practice. Analysing these theories and their limits strengthened my ability to evaluate policies critically, preparing me to study these complexities at degree level.\n\nI explored these ideas further in my extended essay on Armenian sovereignty post-2020, analysing how historical legacies and contextual challenges shaped governance and stability, and gaining a deeper appreciation for the complexity of political decision-making in post-conflict states.\n\nBuilding on the research skills I developed writing my essay, I founded a student-led research journal to explore political events from multiple perspectives. Through the journal, I examined a wide range of development issues, from Costa Rica's near-carbon-neutral policies to other international initiatives, which broadened my understanding of how states may implement different strategies to achieve developmental goals.\n\nTogether, these experiences allowed me to analyse complex political challenges, evaluate competing strategies for sustainable development, and engage critically with multiple perspectives, equipping me to study these issues at university.\n\nQuestion 3:\nTo better understand how development initiatives reach vulnerable communities, I contributed to projects addressing food insecurity at the UN World Food Programme, analysing patterns in aid distribution and assessing their effects on local communities. This experience demonstrated the influence of large IGOs, further emphasising the complexity of the interactions between actors in politics and giving me a deeper appreciation for the mechanisms and structures that underpin the field.",

In my view, contrarily, intelligence is the ability to grasp the intricate and multifaceted nature of society itself. Over the last three years, I have pursued this broader understanding by gaining insight into areas such as business, sociology, and most personally influential to me, law.\nThe law is not merely a set of fixed rules to ensure social order but a reflection of our progress – tangible markers of our body politic in constant motion. It is, however, important to note that the pace of this progression is often uneven. As society rapidly develops and shifts, legal reform is constrained by precedent and parliamentary primacy. I identified this tension while studying An Introduction to English Law through the University of London's MOOC in 2023. Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 effectively demonstrates this: courts may make a declaration of incompatibility with fundamental rights, as seen in Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza (2004), but this does not compel amendment. This can prolong the life of laws that no longer reflect current morality in favour of preserving parliamentary sovereignty.  Law captivates me because it demands rigorous analysis – challenging not just doctrinal coherence, but its underlying moral logic and consequential effects on society. Where strict legal frameworks collide with questions of justice and real-world outcomes, it fuels my drive to study law more deeply.\nMy particular interest lies where business and human rights intersect; my father and I constantly converse about corporate ethics and accountability. The conversations are where my love for corporate and commercial law arose and where I started to see how legal structures don't just sit there on paper; they actively shape the way companies behave, with their effects rippling across society and the economy. Having passionate discussions and heated debates over complex legal matters has given me purpose and motivation. Most importantly, though, it has helped form my moral compass, harnessing my belief in social responsibility.\nTo build a stronger foundation in this area, I completed Clifford Chance's Business and Human Rights virtual job simulation. I discovered how mergers and acquisitions, as well as litigation teams, play a legitimate role in protecting human rights – not just chasing deals or fighting lawsuits. I also found myself digging through an overwhelming amount of information, most of it not particularly useful, just to extract the relevant legal arguments. That process sharpened my research skills and made me a lot more efficient at communicating with clients in clear, focused language. This experience confirmed that law is where I want to be. It's a field that demands both analytical precision and a strong sense of ethics – exactly the kind of challenge that motivates me.\nLaw captivates me precisely because it forces a confrontation between ideals and reality, exposing the underlying rhythms of society. Each principle lives beyond the page, shaping the world and testing the kind of intelligence I value most.",

    "statement_full_text": "During my study of \"An Introduction to English Law\" through the University of London's MOOC in 2022, I became particularly intrigued by the ongoing tension between evolving societal values and the legal structures that attempt to regulate our body politic. I explored this tension by examining Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998, specifically its contribution to the case of Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza (2004). In this case, the House of Lords had to decide whether a same-sex partner could inherit a statutory tenancy after the original tenant's death. Notably, while the court issued a declaration of incompatibility – explicitly recognising that the law discriminated based on sexual orientation – Parliament faced no obligation to amend the statute in response.\nI find it outrageous, but fascinating that the legal system can formally acknowledge an injustice yet allow it to persist – claiming to prioritise continuity and parliamentary sovereignty over adaptation to changing morality and beliefs. When analysing the judiciary's approach to this dilemma, I observed how courts must balance the protection of individual rights against the constraints of legal doctrine and the supremacy of Parliament. This highlighted the interdependence of law and morality and demonstrated that legal reasoning does not always seamlessly align with societal impact, inspiring my interest in legal study.\nMy particular interest lies where business and human rights intersect. I have not had the chance to take part in official debates, so I have begun watching lectures and dissecting arguments myself. A lecture on corporate accountability really interested me and I structured my notes around two opposing positions. On one hand, corporations carry a moral responsibility to protect workers and ensure fair treatment, even if this cuts into profits. On the other hand, some argue that simply staying within statutory requirements is enough to satisfy corporate duties. This is where my love for corporate and commercial law arose and where I started to see how legal structures don't just sit there on paper; they actively shape the way companies behave, with their effects rippling across society and the economy.\nTo develop my understanding of this area, I recently completed Clifford Chance's Business and Human Rights virtual job simulation. This provided me with an opportunity to view legal issues from the perspective of both litigation and mergers and acquisitions teams. Within the M&A team, I analysed potential human rights risks inherent in corporate transactions, reviewing supply chain labour practices and considering the broader consequences for local communities. While with the litigation team, I undertook legal research, drafted responses to client queries, and synthesized complex evidence for presentations – always weighing not just the legal merits but the ethical and societal implications of pursuing or settling claims.",
