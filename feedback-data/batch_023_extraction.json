    "statement_full_text": "Reading Goodwin's \"Values, Voice and Virtues\" challenged my position by arguing education, not class forms the dominant social cleavage but I was not totally convinced. I felt he overlooked the structural influence of class upon education. His notion that globalisation is the cause of our increasingly polarised politics struck me as particularly interesting as it bridged my interest in politics and economics, which inspired me to read Sandel's The Tyranny of Merit. I concur with Sandel's view that the current application of meritocracy has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy, resulting in the growth of populism as a reaction to increased inequality. It seems that meritocracy conflicts with our self interested nature as we prioritise personal gain over fairness. I explored the impact of our \"non ideal\" human characteristics in Joseph Chan's Confucian Perfectionism which provided a compelling alternative to Western liberalism, as it reconciled both meritocracy and social cohesion. Whilst his pluralist reconstruction of Confucianism fascinated me, the current resurgence of Confucian ideas in China highlights the power of political philosophy in promoting authoritarianism by legitimising hierarchical governance.",

    "statement_full_text": "Formula 1's relentless pursuit of aerodynamic performance throughout history due to competition between teams has led to the use of aerodynamic wings in refrigerators, to improve energy conservation. Engineering is a feature of our everyday lives and it has been something that has interested me ever since I started watching F1. Perhaps due to this passion, I wrote my EPQ on the 2026 Formula 1 Regulations. Every piece of knowledge I gained from this has driven my interest for engineering, especially how sustainability is integrated into F1 and other engineering industries. How air flows over vehicles fascinates me, which is why I am also interested in aerospace. Having read the book \"Introduction to Flight\" by J.D. Anderson, I was able to learn about basic aerodynamics and influential engineers. This insight has improved my understanding of aerofoils and wings. This helped widen my scope of engineering and made me even more eager to study it at University so I could further improve this knowledge of aerodynamic shapes. A \"Future Cities\" Smallpeice Trust course that I attended also helped me discover a different area of engineering that particularly intrigues me. During this course, I was able to learn about how structures are made such as bridges and how sustainability is being introduced into transport and energy. I was able to discover the potential benefits and drawbacks of introducing EVs and AVs and how this will affect society. This knowledge was also amplified during the Siemens work experience that I attended. This improved my understanding of how electrification and renewable energy is becoming increasingly important in industrial processes and transport.\n\nStudying A-level Physics has made a huge difference towards my decision to pick engineering, along with improving my ability to solve complex problems and analyse data. Mechanics have given me deepened understanding of how objects behave under the influences of forces acting upon them, how objects oscillate freely and the affect of damping on oscillating objects. Additionally, Thermal Physics has improved my knowledge of how gas laws apply in real life, and how Kinetic Theory can explain why these gases behave the way they do. Also, studying Mechanics in A-level Maths has also helped prepare me for engineering as I can understand how pulleys and other similar systems are impacted by forces acting upon them. Maths is incredibly important to Engineering, and studying this at A-level has greatly improved my ability to solve problems, think analytically and persevere with roadblocks that I come across.\nDuring my work experience programme at Siemens, I was able to learn about the daily tasks of an engineer, shadow engineers and complete activities that gave me an insight into a career in Engineering. During a tour of a robotics showcasing room, I observed how different robots are designed and integrated into manufacturing. This has deepened my curiosity about how electronics, control systems and robotics. Seeing engineers work together to solve complex problems fascinates me and it has motivated me to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. Additionally, I decided to participate in an aerofoil design competition run by Cambridge University Drone Society. I was able to use CAD and CFD software to design and analyse a half wing. This deepened my understanding of how air behaves around a wing at different angles of attack. I also carried out a personal slot car project. This involved 3d printing a slot car that I had designed on TinkerCad, and using this to make multiple iterations which I tested around a circuit. This taught me the importance of perseverance, the ability to solve problems and data analysis skills. These skills are very important when studying mechanical engineering at University. I have read Adrien Newey's autobiography \"How to build a car\". He describes the events of his career as an engineer in F1 and his innovative designs such as the active suspension on the Williams FW14B.",

Not ⅓ of a metre.\" I protested this decision, confused why I'd lose a mark over something so seemingly trivial, to which I was met with, \"Physics prioritises real-world application; we can't measure something to exactly ⅓ of a metre - our instruments only allow us to measure to a certain degree.\"\n\nIt was this that made me acknowledge what really separated physics from maths: the focus on actually applying the language of the universe to develop our understanding of our world, which is what ultimately drew my ambition to become an engineer - a career that takes this concept to its full potential to improve society.\n\nEager to pursue a taste of this field, I attended my school's Experimental Physics club where I built small electronics like capacitors and speakers with basic items such as paper, tape and coils. Creating such globally significant devices from such simple materials made me realise that engineering, especially electrical and electronic (EEE), isn't just about complexity or advanced machinery but rather problem solving and creativity to utilise what's available - something I later also noticed in the history of the computer in Isaacson's 'The Innovators'.\n\nQuestion 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nRecognising the value of math, I sought to develop my knowledge and critical thinking by completing the Ritangle challenge, and StemSmart where I developed a deep interest in matrices to better understand their applications such as circuit analysis in complex networks using Kirchoff's Laws.\n\nHowever what particularly fascinated me were Pauli matrices which I encountered during a Cambridge maths taster; learning of their role in representing electron spin, I dug deeper and explored their mathematical equivalence to qubit states in quantum computing due to their non-commutativity.\nThis inspired me to write, for the Minds Underground competition, an essay on how advancements like topological states (following Microsoft's breakthrough) in quantum computing could pioneer our future technology by tackling optimisation problems including minimising data loss in wireless communication via quantum cryptography to revolutionise cybersecurity, or enhancing neural network architecture to accelerate machine learning.\n\nThis dive led me to appreciate electronics for realising the fundamental theory behind such systems by providing hardware like semiconductors, as well as the potential for innovation in this rapidly-progressing field such as MEMS miniaturisation. It taught me how to thoroughly research but most importantly it amplified my ability to communicate ideas, a skill vital to engineers, beyond my school experiences in debating competitions and leading a charity-fundraising society.\n\nQuestion 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nEngineers go beyond just the comfort of learning the content - they actually immerse themselves in it. So I conducted work experience at Digital Reality, a renowned data centre where I witnessed first-hand the inner workings of how EEE powered and protected complex computer infrastructure, from transformers stepping down high voltages to circuit breakers and PDUs managing power distribution efficiently. The multitude of systems in place showcased the diligence of electrical engineers, especially the implementation of generators and UPS to ensure power continuity.\n\nI was able to further explore the UPS and how it functions during the Pathways to Bath EEE programme by designing a bridge rectifier on tinkercad with diodes and an LED to convert AC to DC, which I then built on a breadboard during the summer school. I also learnt C++ Arduino programming to later build a motion-activated LED system using an ultrasonic sensor to explore how software drives physical automation - a stepping stone to our AI-and-robot-driven future.\n\nFrom dissecting broken electronics to collect components to experiment with as a child, to now building my own devices to model what I've observed in reality - I've grown not just in skill, but in purpose and wish to continue to evolve in this journey as an engineer.",

    "statement_full_text": "Power rarely announces itself, yet the law reveals it clearly. Though designed to provide shared protection that ensures justice for all, in actual practice the foundation of the law is written in a language foreign to those it professes to protect: as a result of its complexity it often needs higher education, a privilege, to decipher it alone. Watching live proceedings at the Supreme Court, made me aware of how distant the law can feel: presenting itself as a performance of power rooted in centuries old traditions, seeming to be structured to impress- separating itself from public understanding. I am drawn to law not just as a set of rules we follow to preserve order, but as a living system that defines our responsibilities and shapes how we interact with one another; especially being pulled by its potential to evolve, reflecting who we are becoming as a society and as humankind. I want to study law to better understand this system and how it could be reconstructed and challenged to serve all members of society, not just the privileged few. I am particularly interested in the relationship between language and power: how the phrasing, presentation and formalism of law can be used to both empower and exclude. Deborah Rhodes \"access to justice\" reveals the cost of exclusion: when legal language is inaccessible people cannot engage with systems affecting their housing, family and freedom. Displaying a striking example of how language shapes not only understanding but real life outcomes too. Through my academic journey, I have found that studying English literature has primarily fueled my desire for studying law, teaching me the fragility of language: how one word alone can alter and reshape the meaning of a sentence entirely, mirroring the legal system where intricate language is often manipulated by those who craft legal language to serve their own interests. In contrast to those who are less advantaged, who are left to steer through a system that is designed to exclude them. Studying economics has revealed how the law's inaccessibility to the poor stems from structural inequalities. Concepts like the wealth effect show how owning assets creates confidence, fuelling the ability to take risks, qualities that translate to the legal arena, where wealth creates access to better representation and influences jurisdiction. Ultimately, economics has emphasised how financial power embodies and epitomises social advantage. My work experience with AHZ solicitors enhanced my understanding beyond the curriculum: I was presented with the opportunity to witness the unfiltered language of the law in action through observing a police interview. I watched as the officers recited the caution, \"anything you say may be used against you in court\". I recognised that for someone unfamiliar with the legal system, this phrase can sound vague while appearing to be neutral. Even when legal rights are explained, linguistic barriers can create a false sense of empowerment. For example, being told you have the right to remain silent to some may seem like an assurance of justice but without the contextual knowledge to truly understand the weight of that right can become an illusion of protection. Silence, meant to protect, can instead be interpreted as guilt, leaving individuals defenceless and vulnerable to manipulations of authority. What appears as empowerment, in practice, can hurt those less able to work through judicial processes. Alan Siegel's TED-ED talk on simplifying legal jargon helped me explore this observation further. Siegel states that \"simplicity is a means to achieve clarity, transparency and empathy.\" Applying this philosophy directly to the law helped me recognise that the simplification of legal language is not about sacrificing precision of the legal field but how it instead redistributes power, ensuring legal inclusivity. As ultimately if you cannot understand your legal rights, do they really even exist?",

    "statement_full_text": "1 June 24, 2022 I was sparked about the legal system, when Roe v Wade was overturned. It had left me wondering if women's autonomy was even a top priority for governments anymore. My personal belief about how the legal system worked and how it was made to protect citizens fell apart as high ranking officials only cared about election results and their own affiliations as the laws never affected them. How fair is the legal system if the people in power lack the same experiences as the ones they're making new bills and regulations for? Laws are unpredictable and one quick decision would always harm, reshape, and affect the lives of millions of people. This pivotal event of my life where I developed courage to look into things with intentions to learn and grow, sparking determination to study law to understand the difficult legal processes, and engage critically with the principles of fairness and equality.Throughout studying my A levels, the subject English language has taught me how even language itself is tied to power and authority. Learning about the two theorists O'Barr and Atkins courtroom research demonstrated how different linguistic features can subtly influence the outcomes of cases in the court leading to the particular judgments of how the defendants, witnesses and victims are perceived by the judge, the whole court or the jury. I found this is personally remarkable because cross-examination where there are tons of leading questions involved may discredit their testimonies which shape the jurors with a new mindset, this leads to the evaluation of how language should be used to highlight justice instead of injustice. Linking this with my BTEC law course, I have gained knowledge about understanding of cases, more complex legal terminology, and even how the process of law making works in the uk. Alongside that I am also undertaking an EPQ titled \"why are criminals not convicted or punished correctly if the evidence finds them guilty of the act\" which allows me to explore how miscarriages of justice can critically reflect on the effectiveness of legal systems.Participating in Model United Nations outside my education has refined me to write resolution papers under timed conditions, with collaborations and under pressure effectively. Representing different countries has encouraged me to step out of the bubbles I already am used to to construct legal, political, persuasive arguments with or against other delegates. Debating peers and chairs has evolved my negotiating and communication skills as the direct advocation for the agendas while developing consensus through agreed resolutions and bloc formations, all of this work was then recognised as I have successfully achieved awards such as best delegate and Honourable mention. Reading Tom Bingham's \"the rule of law\" book further deepened my interest in law, especially chapter 7 on international law. While I understood his compelling emphasis on human rights, I was left with questions after that, wondering how effective these enforcements would be when powerful states disregard international laws due to political influence, corrupting the legal frameworks that were developed to protect the human rights of the people. The question was then how can the gap between legal principles and their practical application be bridged, suggesting that I figure it out by approaching the study of law with both curiosity but also with a critical perspective. In addition to these two experiences, I took a coursera course by the University of London introducing myself to the English common law from key cases to practice tests. This independent study has enabled me to fully comprehend the English common law system in a more general understanding and to see how rules are applied and enforced. Lastly, I adapted the podcast \"Law Pod UK\" more into my daily routines as it kept me up with the recent debates and legal issues, making myself more aware of my surroundings and critical thinking skills.",
