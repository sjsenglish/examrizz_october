    "statement_full_text": "Mathematics and computer science are subjects focused on problem solving.  Being able to overcome an obstacle while trying to reach a goal resonates deeply with me due to my ardent love for challenges. A topic which piques my interest is the concept of infinity.  Infinity is something that has no limits. Infinity is so fundamental in mathematics because of its role in calculus as calculus' limit and derivative cannot be defined without infinity. One of the main basics of calculus, integration, was created by ancient mathematicians cutting up shapes with no definite lines (e.g. circles) into infinite parts to get its area. Infinity inspires me to imagine a world that is so much broader than what I would ever experience in my short, finite life on earth. The recursion theory is another concept based on Infinity. Recursion is when a function calls on itself. Recursion theory is the study of when a function calls on itself infinitely. The concept captivates me as a result of its crucial role in the development of AI as it allows AI to self develop and understand its limits.\nThe book \"Zero, the Biography of a Dangerous Idea\" by Charles Seife has fueled my passion for mathematics and computing. Through the author's walk into the history of zero from the 1st to the 21st century, I was able to learn fascinating ideas like infinitesimal, infinity, Zeno's paradox, thermodynamics, the origin of numbers and how religion links to mathematics . This book has opened my mind to how deep mathematics is ingrained in our history and how much humans have relied on it.\nThrough the MOOC called \"Introduction to web development with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript\" I am able to have an understanding of web and cloud development as I have a grasp of the importance of front and back end development and their respective roles in developing a website.Additionally, I have learnt the different types of frameworks needed for and syntax of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript . Through the course, I have completed three coding projects which included HTML,CSS and JavaScript. These projects have led me to a deeper comprehension of how each of the programming languages above work.\nCompleting the Bronze Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award (iDEA) has enhanced my knowledge of digital literacy. Spectris online work experience introduced me to how different technologies and equipment are used in real world scenarios. Being able to walk through the labs and production areas gave me a clearer understanding of how theory translates into practical application.\nAs a prefect and member of the student council, I have been able to apply my problem-solving skills to the real world by sharing the concerns and ideas of my peers with the school administration and promoting equality and diversity through planning school events such as 'day of languages'.  \nHelping people to become a better version of themselves is a motto I abide to. One way I apply my motto is by being a math mentor. Mathematics being a subject I feel entirely confident in, is not easy to teach. Being able to show patience, kindness and build trust in my mentees is a little challenging but by formulating good teaching methods and being engaging, I am able to be a good mentor.\nFurthermore, learning ice skating has instilled in me a positive mindset and resilience as I have to pick myself up when I fall down. It has taught me to push myself out of my comfort zone and turn challenges into opportunities. Crocheting which involves a lot of counting and keeping tabs on my work has built my focus and concentration because getting distracted often lead to mistakes. This has led to me being able to make fewer mistakes when working on math and coding problems.\nI currently volunteer at British Heart Foundation. I am tasked with tagging and sorting clothes, putting up displays and keeping a clean and welcoming shop environment. I have gained experience in teamwork and time management by working with staff and volunteers.",

    "statement_full_text": "My interest in neuroscience was established through my unique experiences mentoring children who struggle with reading, as well as my opportunity to spend time in Rwanda with SURF, working with survivors of the genocide. The differences in perception between people was crucial in both experiences, from children with dyslexia to those with brain damage. The stories of the survivors inspired me to look further and read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, where the man with no memory of murder fascinated me with the implications it held for how memory shapes perception. This was a topic of neuroscience I was interested in since hearing stories from Rwanda of the ways trauma manifests, and I connected this to my knowledge of allostasis and PTSD, leading to an interest in biological impacts of trauma. Additionally, the story of the 'autist artist' José, combined with the idea that an influx of external signals may cause overstimulation in ASD (as discussed in the podcast Brain Stories), furthered my interest into the subject of neuroscience - cognition specifically.\n\nAcross my subjects I have gained many analytical skills, as well as vital practice at modelling and communicating my ideas. The EPQ has developed my ability to express my opinions and evaluate an issue, as well as teaching me crucial techniques for research, planning, and organisation. My AS in further maths taught me valuable skills, particularly in statistics and linear algebra, as well as introducing me to topics like Dijkstra's algorithm, which could pose incredibly useful for modelling the pathways of the brain. I thrive off complex problems, and have competed in multiple challenges offered through college for chemistry and maths. The RSC Analyst Challenge was incredibly rewarding, where I enhanced my problem solving skills, practical lab work, teamwork, and my ability to plan ahead - resulting in my team placing first for my school. The C3L6 and UKMT pushed me to problem solve and apply my knowledge of the subjects in a way that typical exams don't require, which I found strengthened my critical thinking. I achieved a silver certificate in the UKMT, and a gold for C3L6.\n\nAttending a medical seminar at school about dementia piqued my interest in neurodegeneration, as well as providing a strong idea of what studying the brain is like. My reading of the book The Brain: The Story of You, where Eagleman provides insightful explanations of complex systems and ideas, such as prejudice and consciousness, provided a base idea of the different aspects of neuroscience. My ensuing curiosity led me to the Hello, Brain! exhibition at the Francis Crick Institute, where I talked to researchers and students. These conversations provided insight into where the course can lead, such as the data analysis and computational sciences used to map different pathways of the brain, or research into dementia. The majority of the exhibition covered aspects of neuroscience I had never considered - such as adaptations of animal brains or the activity of the brain while sleeping. I was especially fascinated by the research that has revealed that the brains of birds 'replay' and practice songs during sleep. This incited my curiosity into the role of the human brain during sleep - leading to my entry in the Big Think 2025 competition, under the medical science question. My research for this taught me the SCN's role in allowing us to sleep, as well as what occurs during sleep: consolidating memory, the role of the glymphatic system, and varying brain waves. This provided insight into what self-motivated research of the brain is like, whilst furthering my knowledge and interest in neuroscience. My work experience for Reed Mobility involved similar research into the connections between psychology and driving, where I wrote a series of articles on different aspects of this. This taught me to write and analyse research scientifically, and my article on safety was published on the website's blog.",

    "statement_full_text": "What determines a marketing success: a persuaded or instinctive consumer? A Harvard Business Review podcast with Leslie Zane argued that persuasion is a marketer's mistake as decisions reside in the instinctive, not the conscious mind. This insight reshaped my view of consumer behaviour, showing me that rational persuasion is unrealistic. I began questioning how to influence the instinctive mind, which led me to connect this to other management areas like finance and pricing. For example, setting discount rates can spark impulse buys while strategic pricing can change buyers' feelings. This demonstrates that management success grows from its interrelated parts, fuelling my desire to study this subject.\n\nSeeing persuasion's flaws made me question consumer rationality, leading me to the concept of homo economicus where humans are rational actors to maximise utility. However, Robert Skidelsky's \"What's Wrong With Economics?\" revealed its oversimplification by critiquing the impossibility in predicting the future making forecasting useless which prompted my exploration of behavioural economics. Kahneman's and Tversky's argument about human choices being both logical and irrational via fast and slow thinking challenged my idea of neural signals. I came to understand that while the nervous system quickly triggers reactions, the purchasing decision resides in our mental systems and individually-shaped instincts. Thus, consumer behaviour's complexity makes me value psychology in marketing management.\n\nSkidelsky's critiques on mathematical modelling piqued my interest in financial management models, leading me to watch a lecture at MIT OpenCourseWare on discount rates. This sparked my interest in risks (beta), where I learned to calculate it using the bottom-up method where it averages betas of similar firms with similar products, challenging my statistical skills. I argue this adds errors as averages hide variability in product demand from different firms leading to inaccuracy, supporting Skidelsky's view that modelling assumes the open world as closed for mathematical convenience. I then question whether basic descriptive statistics suffice in business analysis, which I hope to explore through advanced quantitative methods like discrete and continuous probability distributions in quantifying risks.\n\nMy interest in discounts led me to pricing strategies highlighting a link between ethics and economics through the concept of reservation price (RP). Reading a research article on using survival prediction models to estimate RP, a consumer's true RP is unseen and inferred from reactions. Tools like the Cox model address this by predicting personalised RP but raises fairness issues. The article argued that this is acceptable as consumer-specific prices like student discounts exist. Yet, I found this flawed as it assumes uniform price elasticities, which is unrealistic since students vary in RP values. To me, personalised pricing still induces disputes in society as prices are based solely on RP which differs per individual. However, I do question the ethics of uniform pricing since it risks price discrimination against the poor and whether personalised prices are fairer. This fuels me to know how pricing can balance strategy and ethics by learning strategies in business.\n\nAt Harvard Undergraduate Ventures-TECH Summer Programme, I completed an internship project with ReachFaster. My team analysed Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) of various AI engines to assess AI responses using metrics. Overall, we concluded that ChatGPT scored highest across four industries and used its flaws to suggest improvements. Personally, improving credible customer feedback in AI responses resonated with me, as it linked to my belief that decisions are instinctive. Feedbacks shape buyers' instincts, as they trust unbiased and relatable information, making marketability effective. At university, I hope to further foster relationships through group projects like this.",

    "statement_full_text": "I am driven by the conviction that engineering is the only tool powerful enough to negotiate with nature. It therefore frustrates me that our innovations serve convenience, while environmental crises only accelerate. The aviation industry alone is responsible for roughly 2.5% of the world's carbon emissions and up to 4% of global warming. Presenting at the COP16 environmental conference to advocate for greater sustainability in engineering sparked my interest in learning more about sustainable aviation. Seeking richer understanding, I visited a NASA exhibition; interacting with mechanisms such as gyroscopes and thrust simulators introduced me to new concepts like angular momentum. Witnessing these principles firsthand transformed my view of everyday interactions, revealing to me the problem-solving challenges beneath seemingly simple mechanisms. This experience, combined with my fascination with planes, led me to undertake a larger-scale research project on achieving net-zero flight, culminating in my writing a paper on the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). While researching the barriers to using SAFs, I argued that the use of modern technologies, like hybrid electric propulsion engines, serve as a solution. Combining conventional engines with electric motors reduces the amount of fuel consumed during flight, thus lowering emissions and making the adoption of SAFs more practical by relieving pressure on supply. Investigating this demonstrated how engineering provides an opportunity for change, fueling my desire to study this course at degree level.\n\nI enjoy keeping up to date with scientific developments. As a member of the Royal Aeronautical Society, reading the monthly journals has exposed me to the latest developments in the field. I found Airbus's testing of an open fan engine particularly exciting, due to its use of exposed fan blades to create complex aerodynamic vibration and noise problems that require innovative materials and precise design to solve. Reading \"The Jet Engine; Rolls Royce\" clearly explained the engineering behind these engines, and how the high bypass ratio both improves propulsive efficiency, and can reduce fuel consumption by 20%. This taught mne how to quantify the environmental impact, which I previously believed was too abstract to measure. To gain a more refined insight, I watched \"Absolute Zero\", a lecture by Julian Allwood, in which he explains that achieving absolute zero emissions means eliminating fossil fuels, not just relying on offsets or future technologies. Comparing his skeptical view with perspectives I am more familiar with as an aviation enthusiast, such as the Airbus ZeroE initiative, challenged much of the earlier research I had conducted in writing my paper.\n\nDuring my engineering internship at HanmiGlobal, I was intrigued by the varying opinions of engineers on the feasibility of eco-friendly structures. As a result, I spent my time there designing irrigation systems that reuse water in arid climates. I explored how one of the sites could incorporate water treatment as part of their irrigation plan to source water sustainably, by utilising centrifugal separators and Tesla valves. This gave me a deeper understanding of some practical applications of fluid mechanics. I strive to encourage younger kids to pursue STEM, having founded my school's Engineering Society. This involves managing and planning collaborative articles and research projects that the society runs, such as a paper on the influence of AI on various engineering disciplines. I worked in the aerospace section, focusing on analysing AI's application in flight optimisation. Additionally, I tutor GCSE students in Maths, and Economics. I play an active role in my school's sustainability mission through my position as a TASS ambassador, and leader of the eco-committee for the past five years. Outside of school, I pursue athletics and art. I have won gold medals in athletics at a national level, and hold my school's records for the 100m and 200m sprints. I also run a successful art business, selling landscape paintings and watercolour postcards.",

    "statement_full_text": "History and politics have always been passions of mine. The main draw of history for me is the way it allows us to understand both others and ourselves. Studying the history of people, countries, and movements contextualises their actions and their experience, but the analytical and critical thinking skills that are developed through history can also be applied to the self and your own actions. This subject has allowed me to question my own beliefs and thought process, which I find hugely important.\n\nIn my opinion, politics ties very closely into history and is valuable in many of the same ways. It allows for practical application and exploration of the historical lessons we have learnt, and can impact our current world to a massive extent. Politics allows us to be fully immersed and involved in a debate, and to argue an opinion which is something I genuinely enjoy.\n\nI study both history and politics at A-level, which has been crucial to learning analytical and evaluative skills. My studies have also exposed me to some of my favourite periods of history and aspects of political debate. It has fostered a keen interest in modern political history through my study of post-war 20th century Britain in history and prime ministerial case studies in politics. The unit we did on Thatcherism was especially interesting to me, and inspired me to do my NEA on its impact on the New Labour movement. I have already started to develop the necessary skills to study history and politics, through essay writing as well as starting the aforementioned history coursework. My development of these skills is reflected in my predicted A* in both subjects.\n\nMy third subject, chemistry, is less immediately relevant to a history and politics course, but has still been crucial to my academic development. Learning skills such as problem solving, pattern recognition, and application of theory has been relevant and applicable to all three of my subjects. Fostering my problem solving and application skills has also allowed me to use what I already know to think creatively and make more nuanced and complex points in my essays.\n\nMy wider reading has also developed my interest in my subjects. Reading 'The Jakarta Method' by Vincent Bevins was particularly impactful for me as it covers lesser-known western intervention in the third world. It made me consider my own position as someone from a former imperial power, and complex motivations of countries and international relations in a post-colonial era. Furthermore, it encouraged my interest in the post-war period and allowed me to draw connections to the decolonisation unit of my British history course.\n\nSomething else that I found helpful was listening to the BBC podcast 'Invisible Hands'. It discusses the origins and rise of the neoliberalism movement, from Friedrich von Hayek to Thatcher as prime minister, and deepened my understanding of economic theory. It gave me perspective on the movement and the people behind it: being able to get a contextual understanding of the circumstances in which they were living, and the struggles of living under consensus politics, gave me a more nuanced understanding of the movement.\n\nSomething else I have done to prepare me for this course is helping set up and attending a Model UN through my school. This experience was especially valuable as it let me develop my research and presentation skills, through independently researched position papers and organised debate in a large group. Furthermore, I have volunteered with the National Archives to help transcribe historical documents into a digital format on FromThePage.\n\nOutside of academics, I am a humanities prefect aiming to promote the humanities subjects in a largely STEM-focused school. I have also run LGBTQ+ society since September 2024, which has improved my planning, organisation, and public speaking skills. Over summer, I also completed work experience with Deutschebank and the law department of Broadridge.",
