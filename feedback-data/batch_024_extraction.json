    "statement_full_text": "Reading Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, I was confronted with a series of arbitrary acts of violence, that are sanctified through self-aggrandising doctrine of Manifest Destiny. The novel identifies American exceptionalism as the ideological driver of the atrocities committed by its characters, framing brutality against indigenous peoples as a moral necessity. This prompted me to reflect on how nations use myth to legitimise conquest and sparked a deeper interest in how political ideas are constructed and weaponised. My curiosity intensified when I read Vladimir Putin's 2021 essay On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, which echoed the same logic of entitlement I had found in McCarthy's novel. Putin dismisses Ukrainian sovereignty as a historical error showing how identity and ethnicity continue to shape international conflict. This led me to question the validity of realism as a means of explaining the actions that nations take and instead explore constructivist approaches to international relations theory that better accounted for how countries interact with their regional history and use ideology in their relations with other nations. It was through these encounters with literature and theory that I became driven to study politics and international relations.\n\nIn school i had the opportunity to be taught about human rights by law students in the ucl access to justice programme, in the module \"human rights across the world\" we discussed how institutions such as the un attempt to protect human rights globally, I was specifically interested by the nato intervention in Bosnia and how humanitarian crisis can cause nations to act outside out of their direct interest,as i read more about the conflict i came across John mearshimer who argued that the conflict had little security significance and that moral arguments for intervention were merely \"liberal illusion\", the friction between the policy suggestions of realist theory and the actions that states actually take left me sceptical of realism's place contemporary international politics.\n\nThis same scepticism resurfaced when I watched Mearsheimer's lecture \"the causes and consequences of the Ukraine war\" i was left unsatisfied with his assertion that Russia's invasion was an act of \"offensive realism\" taken in order to combat NATO's eastward expansion, certainly the war in Ukraine has come at an immense material cost to Russia while also acting as the catalyst for Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO. In looking for alternative theories for the cause of the conflict, I came across an euideas article titled \"John Mearshimer's lecture on Ukraine, why he's wrong and what are the consequences\",the article stresses how the monocausal reasoning that Mearsheimer deploys in his lecture completely sidesteps the domestic and ideological motivation for Putin's invasion, however what struck me the most was the observation that it is irresponsible to use ir theory in place of concrete evidence, especially when academic framing is used to legitimise aggression. Later, I read \"how democracy ends\" by David Runciman as research for the northeastern university essay competition, the book further emphasises the role that language and speech hold in politics, arguing that social media has made rhetoric more personal and dramatic as compresses discourse and turns it into a performance meant to generate soundbites and viral moments. In my essay I discussed how far reaching the effects of social media have been in politics: particularly its role in weakening legacy media, accelerating the spread of misinformation, creating echo chambers and facilitating stochastic terrorism . In entering this competition I learned how to conduct effective interdisciplinary research and put together creative arguments that encompass political science, media studies and sociology.\n\nDuring my work experience at the October gallery I saw how artists outside of the western mainstream aren't afforded the same opportunities in creative institutions and how global cultural exchange can shape perceptions of entire people groups. This made me reflect more broadly on the politics of representation and which voices they chose to platform. Being raised by a former member of the black panther party this reflection resonated with me as conversation oppression and the right to representation were ever present in my household.",

    "statement_full_text": "Q1\n\"Why do we pay for water? Why are houses so expensive? Why are some people richer than others?\" As a child I asked these questions to my dad, an Economics teacher, who explained them in ways I could understand and turned them into discussions that made me feel they mattered. After he died when I was eight, I held onto those conversations. They mattered not only because they kept me close to him, but because they revealed how childhood curiosities expose deeper truths about fairness, power, and opportunity. Over time I came to realise they were not small questions, they define whose lives are valued, whose voices are heard, and how prosperity is measured.\nI began to explore these questions through books that challenged conventional ways of thinking about progress and inequality. Doughnut Economics reframed prosperity within ecological ceilings and social foundations. The Spirit Level was persuasive in showing that equality improves outcomes across health and trust, though I wondered if cultural and political contexts complicate its conclusions. This led me to Post Growth, which questioned whether growth should remain central, yet I felt it underplayed urgent development needs in the global South. I realised models are never neutral; each highlights some realities while obscuring others.\nI became especially drawn to the point where theory meets policy. British Columbia's carbon tax, redistributing revenue to households, showed how design can achieve equity and sustainability, while the Green New Deal's proposals for public investment showed how institutions might drive change. Together they showed that economics can be generative, not reactive. My curiosity widened to how migration reshapes communities, how trade delivers efficiency while deepening dependency, and how urban growth creates opportunity but also exclusion.\nWhat began with my questions has grown into a determination to explore these tensions further. I want to strengthen the analytical tools I have begun to develop, to investigate how economic and geographical systems confront inequality, development, and sustainability, and to imagine fairer alternatives.\nQ2\nMy academic interests led me to enter several essay competitions, where I explored issues from aviation expansion and climate commitments to social identity in policy. The Oxford PPE essay, on whether economic growth is compatible with climate action, forced me to grapple with whether prosperity must always be measured by growth and how climate limits challenge it. This taught me to read critically, interpret academic journals, and reference confidently. I then utilised these skills whilst completing my Geography NEA on second-home ownership and community viability in Salcombe and Hope Cove. I collected and analysed primary data, strengthening my research skills. Confronting issues of affordability and seasonal demand led me to Planetary Gentrification, which helped me situate local restructuring within global processes of displacement and uneven development.\nQ3\nBeyond research, I sought experiences that challenged me to communicate clearly, think under pressure, and connect theory to daily life. Preparing an assembly on consumption and waste for a primary school taught me how to simplify global issues, while politics and philosophy debating sharpened my arguments. Wanting to see how economics operates institutionally, I completed an online course in investment banking and spent a day at the Bank of England, seeing how policy and markets interact.\nVolunteering in a charity shop showed how redistribution works, with goods moving from surplus to need and communities relying on reuse. It made tangible the questions I had explored about inequality and the value of goods, deepening my awareness of how inequality and sustainability are felt in communities. Such dedication developed the skills, motivation, and willingness to learn that prepare me for the perseverance demanded by university study and the ambitions I aim to pursue.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1:\nRepresenting the United Kingdom at LSEMUN in a debate on how to ensure humanitarian aid reaches conflict zones, I was confronted with a key question: when should moral principles override political necessity in international relations? This experience sparked a profound interest in the ways in which states uphold ethical principles whilst preserving their national sovereignty. Reading Singer's 'Famine, Affluence and Morality' convinced me of the the fact that states with the capacity to prevent human rights violations have the duty to act, yet Bull's 'The Anarchical Society' challenged this idea by arguing that the pursuit of justice can undermine world order and create greater instability. This tension is what drives my passion to understand the actions of states and their global consequences.\n\nQuestion 2:\nMy understanding of the far-reaching socioeconomic impacts of political decisions was strengthened when I studied the Partition of India for my History A-Level. I was struck by the communal violence and malnutrition that resulted from the disruption of trade networks, and developed a commitment to addressing the human consequences of economic instability. This inspired me to explore the war in Ukraine's exacerbation of grain and fertiliser flows to sub-Saharan Africa in my data research project. My conclusion, that disrupted supply chains and fertiliser shortages have driven many in Sub-Saharan Africa further into food poverty, broadened my perspective on how conflict in one region can inadvertently exacerbate suffering in another.\n\nQuestion 3:\nVolunteering for Amnesty International, I gained a first-hand insight into human rights challenges worldwide. This strengthened my passion for studying government polices and how they impact vulnerable groups. As a result, I attended a talk at Chatham House on the topic of 'How are states responding to changing world order?'. An argument that particularly appealed to me was one addressing budget cuts to vital programs such as the World Food Program, and how this would impact ongoing health crises. The speaker's emphasis on the need for cross-regional approaches prompted me to consider how humanitarian and strategic aspirations can both be met through effective policy alignment. Intrigued by this argument, I explored it further in my essay for the RA Butler competition, in which I argued that international institutions are not fundamentally at odds with national sovereignty due to shared governance. Through researching World Health Organisation's 'surveillance and containment' scheme for smallpox elimination, I argued that such collaboration offers a model for future crises.",

Higher Chemistry and Personal Statement1Higher Physics have also helped me develop my application of knowledge into new and abstract situations.\n\nIn my younger years, partaking in a robotics class using LEGO Mindstorms EV3, introduced the concept of procedural programming and the importance of the order in which the code is written in interpreted languages, whilst my experience writing code on Roblox also introduced me to object-oriented programming and served as a foundation for using languages such as Java as well as videogame programming using Unity and Roblox Studio.\n\nBeyond the academic scene, programmes like the Future Leaders Programme aswell as student leadership and prom committee in my previous school helped me develop soft skills such as time management, communication and leadership, organising and presenting ideas within deadlines, skills necessary in software development roles. Following this, I created a local Whatsapp-based revision group for my peers during GCSEs to share resources whilst improving on my own knowledge by providing help. This experience further developed my organisation, leadership and time management skills\n\nQ3\n\nOutside my education, I explored the mathematical aspects of computing by enrolling in the Scottish maths challenge. Attaining silver, the experience allowed me to combine both my mathematical problem solving skills with my programming abilities to abstract problem solving scenarios, writing algorithms that iterate through combinatorics that exceeded 100,000 permutations with time complexities of O(n⁴), Using a slower language like Python taught me the importance of the algorithmic efficiency needed to reduce the conditions to a manageable time frame as well as the restrictions programming languages face in real world applications. The experience further gave me the opportunity, during the award ceremony, to attend a lecture about networking and using matrices to find the degree of nodes, an experience which deepened my interest in learning about linear algebra and its application in computing and AI.\n\nTo explore my interest in the cyber security aspect of computing I partook in the CyberFirst national competition, where I scored 3rd place regionally, Personal Statement2developing skills such as web security, packet sniffing, OSINT and cryptography, where I reverse engineered an RSA encryption using Python as well as web crawlers to exploit vulnerabilities in web pages. This experience developed my interest in OSINT and cryptography, which led me to take several courses on the TryHackMe program which improved my understanding of offensive and defensive security.\n\nIn my spare time, I've undertaken a personal project using the framework Customtkinter to design a movie app, similar to IMDB, integrated with a backend database, allowing for custom user based interfaces as well as search and filtering systems. As something I plan to develop further as my Advanced Higher computing project, this project gave me a practical experience in full stack development from frameworks and UI/UX development to database management, creating real software and catering to user needs.",

    "statement_full_text": "Proteins underpin life: enzymes catalyse reactions in seconds, antibodies defend us and membrane proteins control transport. Their variety captivated me, but what stood out most was that in every protein, structure dictated function.\nAfter hearing about my teacher's experience with sickle cell anaemia, I learnt how a single residue substitution from glutamic acid to valine alters the structure of haemoglobin and causes agglutination. I was curious how such a life-threatening disease could arise from such a small mutation. Suzanne Clancy's article 'Genetic Mutation' showed me that this stems from just one base substitution – adenine to thymine – in the beta globin gene. This idea that a single missense mutation can drastically affect quality of life, disproportionately impacting people of African and Caribbean heritage, drives my ambition to research into genetic disease.\nMy fascination with proteins grew at Balliol College's Try Before You Buy Day, where I explored how protein stability guides vaccine design. I learnt how six stabilising proline substitutions were engineered into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to create the HexaPro variant. This prevents the protein from prematurely collapsing into its post-fusion state, making it more effective as a vaccine antigen. I wondered why alternatives, like disulphide bonds, weren't used instead, only to find that misplaced disulphide bonds risk misfolding and aggregation, impairing the spike protein's trimeric assembly. Seeing how we can understand and manipulate protein structure and conformational dynamics to further public health reinforced my desire to study biochemistry.\nStudying shapes of molecules in A-level Chemistry led to an interest in chirality, which I deepened at a University of Birmingham lecture on enantiomers. It amazed me that thalidomide's two stereoisomers, despite having identical connectivity, have completely different effects.\nWanting to learn more about drug action, I took an OpenLearn course on aspirin, learning how it inhibits COX enzymes by acetylation, preventing prostaglandin production. Linking my knowledge of enzyme inhibition and bonding, I understood how the strength of the covalent bond prolongs the drug's effect. This revealed how knowledge of molecular structure can be harnessed to improve lives through pharmacology.\nA-level Biology has inspired my pursuit of biochemistry. I was intrigued by how chromosomal DNA encodes traits. I enjoyed exploring X-linked traits through Morgan's fruit fly experiments on eye colour at a Cambridge masterclass. Through this I questioned why sex chromosome aneuploidies are more tolerated than autosomal ones. I discovered the role of X-inactivation in balancing gene dosage between sexes, a mechanism absent in autosomes.\nDuring the UNIQ Summer School, I developed my interest in genetics further through lab workshops. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and recombination, I inserted a stop codon in the lacZ gene, with blue-white screening confirming inhibition of beta-galactosidase production. Practising aseptic techniques and micropipetting gave me insight into real research, while seeing gene-editing first-hand excited me about CRISPR's potential to treat sickle cell anaemia. I later learnt how base-editing variants offer more control over gene editing without cutting DNA, making it a safer option. The ethical dilemmas, discussed by Nessa Carey on The Naked Scientists, showed me how science and society must advance together.\nBeyond academics, leading debate sessions, co-running my school's ACS and balancing a part-time job have enhanced my teamwork, leadership and time-management, vital for collaborative research. My passion for linguistics will also be useful for scientific communication.\nFor me, the beauty of Biochemistry lies in its molecules. Their miniscule size yet immense power is the source of the subject's potential. I'm eager to study them in depth and use that knowledge to contribute to meaningful scientific progress.",

Like, what does that mean? Minuscule size, immense power as a source of the subject's potential - I know you probably think the tutors gonna say 'oh wow, a fellow passionate biochemist.' They're just not gonna think that way. You could really save yourself those eight lines and use that elsewhere.",

Your stronger paragraphs (sickle cell, Balliol proteins, UNIQ) are excellent. The weaker ones (chirality, aspirin, X-inactivation) need more development.",
        "improvement_suggested": "Key improvements: 1) Delete opening and closing 'poetry' paragraphs (save ~8 lines each). 2) Work on concise writing throughout - reduce word count while keeping meaning. 3) Use saved characters to develop the three weaker middle paragraphs significantly. 4) Consider condensing extracurricular paragraph to one sentence.
