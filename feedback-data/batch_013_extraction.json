    "statement_full_text": "I believe that politics, philosophy and economics together explain international relations and many conflicts. However western global powers often overlook the intertwining nature of politics and philosophy. This reductionist approach hinders conflict resolution, a wrong that drives me to pursue political studies.\n\nA clear example of this problem is the Russo-Ukrainian war. As I read Intent to Destroy, Zygar acutely displayed Russia's irredentist philosophy towards Kyivan Rus, and how neo-imperial, revanchist ideas have become not just an opinion but a consensus across Russia. The same rhetoric can be heard from Putin to Limonov to Zhirinovsky, men divided in politics yet united in ideology. Despite this, global powers still act on the basis that Russian aggression is driven by the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, a narrow perspective that I believe will not offer Ukraine a long-term solution. Until Russia faces deep internal change, a NATO membership may stop Russia from physically destroying Ukraine, but it will not stop attempts to destroy Ukraine internally. This belief I hold was invigorated as I learned that Russia has defied every single major treaty with Ukraine in the last decade.\n\nIn A level Religious Studies the ethical system I was most interested in was Aristotle's Virtue Ethics and its denotation of Eudaimonia as the telos. Subsequently I read Nicomachean Ethics in which the emphasis on politics subsuming ethics was incredibly poignant. Aristotle's indepth dialogue on which dispositions are virtuous and what constitutes immorality has allowed me to view politics through a Nicomachean lens, in order to be as objective as possible when deciding the immoral party in situations. Inspired by Aristotle's claim that the goal of statesmanship is to enable citizens to flourish, I undertook a research project at the Aim for Oxford Programme exploring which economic system best enables a prosperous state. In this I compared the USA's free market economy and Norway's superior, more managed and Keynesian-style economy. Whilst the USA's economy amasses great amounts of wealth, I determined such a system is not for the many but for the few, yet Norway's corporatism and nationalisation, enabled by the Nordic Model and Sovereign Wealth Fund, allows all of its citizens to flourish.\n\nAfter studying state authority in A level Politics, I considered what actually justifies a state to exert authority and implement aforementioned systems, a question that closely relates to modern conflicts today. Thus I read the chapter on justifying the state in Wolff's An introduction to political philosophy, where Locke's claim of tacit consent intrigued me, however I was not fully convinced. True democracies make errors resulting in protests (as seen by the Euromaidan), yet citizens feeling aggrieved in that moment does not render the state unjustified. Hypothetical consent was far more convincing, for most citizens protest for a better state, not no state at all, indicating consent for the institution, just an improved version.\n\nFollowing from this, the way a state maintains and exerts its authority through language intrigued me. Hrytsak discusses how Russification policies enforced by the Soviet Union made ethnic Ukrainians regard their mother tongue as a second class language, a powerful tool for preventing Ukrainian separatism. This phenomenon I believe is formed due to shared beliefs between both camps in ethnolinguistic nationalism, the belief that a nation stretches as far as the language is heard, so as Ukrainian came under pressure the majority easily assimilated towards both Russian language and assumed culture. This acutely highlighted to me the political power language holds, especially when there is a preexisting philosophy or attitude to language, once again showing a link between politics and philosophy in existing cultures today.\n\nI have engaged in many activities outside of school which have shown me the significance of politics on a local and larger scale. In attending my council's annual budget meeting I was given an insight into how the local economy is managed in devolved bodies. Conversely, I spent a week working in Parliament with my MP during which I sat in North Korea and Ukraine APPGs where I witnessed the interaction between dignitaries and how diplomacy works on a practical level.",

    "statement_full_text": "Psychology is incredibly relevant in this ever-evolving socio-political climate. It equips us with the insight to empathetically navigate the world by decoding behaviour and motivation. While I was drawn to it since I grew up with loved ones who struggled with mental health, so it was a window into their world. Learning how it coincided with their intersectional experience directed my passion to social psychology, especially how social dynamics shapes individual behaviour that is reflected in culture. I believe articulating reasons that underpin these beliefs is essential to understand how our current society, and its most pressing issues, are determined by the people within it.\n\nPsychology seeks to understand behaviour scientifically, with systematic evaluation of empirical evidence. Studying maths and biology, and achieving a silver in UKMT Senior, has prepared me to analytically approach novel scenarios through inference and application of data and theories. Delving into debates in A-level psychology is engaging as it refines my ability to consider ethical and pragmatic nuances for therapies and research methods and prompted me to appreciate how research informs policies that can shape cultural notions.\n\nI relished the freedom of directing my research from exploring the constructive and detrimental impacts of cognitive dissonance in my EPQ. What fascinated me was it accounting for self-justification in decision-making beyond the limits of conditioning. The unease from contradicting ideas both motivates rumination to perpetuate psychiatric disorders and foster echo chambers, while predicting paradoxical decisions applied to interventions. By also interviewing a social worker, devising a correlational questionnaire, and extending my knowledge of statistics to a larger dataset on Excel, I proposed the adaptive regulation of dissonance is focal to it prompting the refinement of motivation. I thoroughly enjoyed taking a nuanced interpretation of decision-making by considering the interaction of self-perception, beliefs and social norms.\n\nFollowing this, I watched John Jost's lecture on system justification: Those most marginalized are likely to validate the alienating status quo. Its motivation to legitimize authority, rather than to preserve a positive self-image (like dissonance), emphasized the vitality of pinpointing belief systems in explaining behaviour. I applied this to my essay for the John Locke Essay Competition, where I argued a person's inferiority is inadvertently intertwined with this phenomenon, their early-life, and sociocultural pressure. It enhanced my ability to form a strong argument when engaging with new ideas, also reflected in me obtaining a First in the Scholar's programme by illustrating how high-growth entrepreneurship can advance my locality socio-culturally with technical and institutional support.\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of psychology excites me. In a work experience programme with an educational psychologist, I simulated planning assessments and interventions for children with memory and phonetic challenges, learning to prioritise a holistic, collaborative approach with CAMHS and speech therapists. I further participated in a taster lecture-Children's Language Development- where a speech therapist analysed the purpose of babies' sound-production stages like cooing and telegraphic speech, and interactions with parents. Both roles applied the theory of zone of proximal development for scaffolding in education to effectively support skill and language acquisition. I expanded upon this knowledge by creating a magazine centred on the link between brain structure and communication for my DofE award where I read Oliver Sack's The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat- a compassionate account of individuals with neurological disorders. It highlighted the role neuroscience in treating, or perhaps more importantly, helping the patient adaptively co-exist with disorders. I was then intrigued by the idea of why music neurologically makes us feel joy. Daniel Levithin's This is your brain on music explains the subversion of rhythmic expectations evolutionarily triggered emotions for rapid flight and survival. These experiences broadened my view of how psychology works in tandem with other fields and demands empathy to reach meaningful insight into behaviour. The multi-faceted, human quality of psychology sparks my passion to pursue it at degree level.\n\nI'm not only driven to satisfy my curiosity of the human condition but also enjoy forming connections with my community by contributing on the Sixth Form council, as a lunchtime supervisor, and volunteer at a charity shop for the past year. I've developed mature, flexible communication and organizational skills by fundraising, and managing storefront. In the Future Leaders programme, I stretched my understanding of behaviour (applied to high-context cultures, emotional intelligence) to improve my leadership skills. Balancing these with my academic priorities helped build a resilient mindset, vital to thriving in my future studies.",

The corruption and lack of opportunity that led my parents to emigrate to the UK revealed how weak institutions stunt progress. This gap between potential and actual performance motivated me to explore the structural factors shaping development and how data can verify them.\n\nQ2) How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nReading Paul Collier's 'The Bottom Billion' made me consider how rent-seeking elites trap nations in 'bad governance', as evidenced by Pakistan's reliance on IMF bailouts. I'd argue that external policy prescriptions, such as IMF-imposed austerity, cannot reform economies where weak institutions reward unproductive elites. Intrigued to see if human rather than physical capital could counteract effects of poor governance, in my research project I used multiple linear regression to test GDP/c growth against Gross Capital Formation and the Human Capital Index across a sample of Asian countries. My results aligned with the augmented Solow model: human capital was the most statistically significant determinant of long-run divergence. Yet, I discovered this didn't capture the non-linear feedback loops, where boosting education can kickstart unpredictable innovation, which drew me to Doyne Farmer's work in complexity economics, in modeling economies as chaotic systems shaped by heuristics. Though traditional economists may dismiss heuristics as imprecise, I believe they better reflect real-world behaviour than models based on rational expectations, accentuating how adaptive policy-making can drive long-term development.\n\nMoreover, in my prize-winning BMS Group Challenge project on natural disaster insurance in developing countries, I used Python to visualise Haiti's seismic data with a geospatial distribution model to map varying risk-zones. I then implemented a microfinance solution to improve regional development by facilitating long-term wealth equality by more affordable tiered premiums, with cross-subsidisation between low-and high-risk regions. Though, considering the case for protectionist intervention in Chang's 'Kicking Away the Ladder' as another potential solution, I'd argue his analysis relied on selective historical cases and lacked econometric evidence to support his causal claims. Therefore, in debt-laden economies like Pakistan, such intervention would likely deepen fiscal inefficiency, reinforcing my view that empirically backed micro-solutions provide a promising basis for effective growth.\n\nFurthermore, I also contend that capital misallocation due to weak institutions hinders development. In MITx's Quantitative Finance MOOC, I examined how the Black-Scholes model extends Geometric Brownian Motion to value derivatives, where I used partial differentiation to better understand the model's stochastic dynamics. I found its constant volatility assumption limiting, as it overlooks the 'jump risk' arising from uncertain policy changes, common in emerging economies. Pastor and Veronesi reinforced this view, as I learned policy risk is itself priced into assets, illustrating to me how this amplifies volatility and shifts capital away to safer, unproductive uses, especially in weaker economies. I concluded that institutional credibility is crucial to positive investor sentiment, since stable policy expectations align financial markets towards inclusive development.\n\nQ3) What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nInterning amongst economists at Alvarez & Marsal, I evaluated green investments exposed to subsidy changes, revealing how standard valuation models overlook institutional and political uncertainty. Seeing how transparent governance narrowed variation in modelling outcomes confirmed that credibility drives investment efficiency and long‑run growth. I aim to study how economics can integrate analytical modelling to design data-driven policies that align micro-level solutions with macro-level development, advancing equitable growth in countries like Pakistan.",

    "statement_full_text": "1) Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nMy fascination with law began during a visit to Nigeria, where I spent time with my family and witnessed the effects of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad on the Nigerian people. I noticed how the same name, 'police', could create a sense of safety for some and fear for others. Hearing accusations of arbitrary detention and extrajudicial killings prompted me to research the Nigerian legal system, where I learned that both Nigeria and the UK function under English Common Law. Section 34(1)(a) in the Nigerian Constitution 1999 and Article 3 of the UK's Human Rights Act 1998 both prohibit torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. As someone of Nigerian ethnicity and British nationality, this struck me and prompted me to question how two legal systems built on the same principles could lead to such vastly different realities for their citizens. Influenced by Lord Bingham's argument that a crucial precept of the Rule of Law is that it 'must afford adequate protection for fundamental human rights', I concluded, in a submission to a newsletter, that this disparity is not due to a contradiction or infringement of Common Law, but rather a failure in its application due to factors such as corruption that inhibit judicial independence.\n\n2) How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nMy A-Level subjects have equipped me with a range of skills that will support my study of Law at university. English Literature has enhanced my critical thinking, strengthened my ability to analyse complex texts, and construct well-reasoned arguments. In my analysis of 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles' and 'Wuthering Heights', I explored the legal context of 19th-century England, particularly inheritance law, and its impact on the characters. This piqued my interest, and to further my knowledge, I subsequently researched how inheritance law has evolved to include those who were previously excluded, such as through the Married Women's Property Act 1882. This Act allowed married women to own and control property independently, overturning earlier laws like the Doctrine of Coverture that had denied them these rights, granting them greater autonomy. To see how this pursuit of equitable rights continued, I analysed the discriminatory pensions in Lloyds Banking Group (2018) in an entry for my legal blog. Through studying Augustus and his rise to power in Classical Civilisation, I became fascinated by how the law was manipulated to establish and legitimise his rule. Augustus' use of laws, such as the Lex Julia, a series of reforms that outwardly promoted traditional Roman values and morality, was used to manipulate the public. By aligning his image with a return to the virtues of the Golden Age, he was able to shape public perception and consolidate his power under the guise of moral reform, showing the versatility of the law.\n\n3) What else have you done to prepare outside of education and why are these experiences useful?\n\nListening to Kathryn Tempest's talk on 'Women \"on trial\" in Cicero's speeches', I was struck by her analysis of how Cicero, while representing male clients, often shifted blame onto women. Despite the law's promise of equality, Cicero's strategies seemed to undermine that principle by using scapegoating. This contradiction fascinated me and led me to explore the topic further in an article I wrote for my school's Classics magazine, where I explored the contrast between law in the classical period and the modern legal system's relatively recent commitment to equality. This interest in fairness also influenced my volunteering experience, where I supported primary school students from underprivileged backgrounds in improving their literacy skills. Teaching the children complex concepts has refined my communication skills, allowing me to convey information clearly and effectively, which would be beneficial to my study of Law. Furthermore, this experience has enhanced my empathy and understanding of the diverse challenges faced by individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds.",
