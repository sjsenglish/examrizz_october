    "statement_full_text": "How vital is the link between the mouth and the body? After witnessing my father's struggle with an infected tooth root and learning that it may have contributed to his existing heart disease, I was curious about the mouth-body connection. This led me to watch a dental talk 'Your oral microbiome is linked to this disease!', in which I learnt that your mouth is a microcosm of systemic health and vital to one's physical and mental wellbeing. Consequently, my appreciation for dentists deepened as I recognised the varied scope of their role. It encompasses much more than just aesthetics; a dentist can detect deeper health issues early through a brief assessment of the mouth. This fascinates me, because not only do dentists help patients feel more comfortable in their smile, they can be life-saving.\n\nMy biology course introduced me to the topic of infectious diseases. Linking this to my interest in oral health, I spent time in Bristol Dental School Research Laboratories shadowing PhD students who were conducting research surrounding a particular oral microbe, viridans streptococci (VGS). Some of the research involved producing a prosthetic material covered in nanostructures with a sharp surface. Currently, it can kill around half of the oral bacteria that lands on it; I predict that with developments in biotechnology and further research on the bacteria's mechanisms, closer to ninety percent could be killed. What particularly interested me as it linked to my father's situation was that while VGS is harmless orally, it can lead to cardiovascular infections if it enters the bloodstream, something that can occur during dental procedures. This deepened my understanding of how important it is for dentists to consider the wider systemic implications of oral care. It is this depth and complexity of dentistry that continues to engage me.\n\nCarrying out science experiments in school has given me the opportunity to showcase resilience, self-reflection and critical thinking; these are key attributes of a dental student when navigating challenging course modules and complex clinical skills. To broaden my awareness of the realities of working in dentistry, I spent two weeks shadowing dentists, nurses, lab technicians and admin staff in a private practice and a NHS dental hospital. Noticing the contrast in equipment quality between the two settings, and the resulting difference in patient experience, underscored the inequality in dental care across socioeconomic backgrounds and deepened my commitment to social responsibility as a future dentist. By observing procedures ranging from fillings and extractions to the creation of prosthetics and orthodontic appliances, I gained insight into the teamwork and communication skills essential for four-handed dentistry while developing an appreciation for the practical craftsmanship of this career. Through observing dentists in various specialties, I came to realise that a strong patient-dentist rapport built on trust, empathy and age-appropriate communication is essential for continuity of care. I have developed such interpersonal skills through my role as an academic and pastoral mentor for Year 11 students, providing reassurance, empathy and active listening to form meaningful relationships with them.\n\nSomething I often noticed was the adaptability of dentists in what can be stressful situations, particularly when initial treatment plans required revision. This ability to adapt while maintaining composure is a skill I have developed through taekwondo competitions, where unpredictable match times require me to stay calm and adjust quickly. Shadowing a restorative dentist, I observed a complex case in which a patient needed a chrome denture splint to stabilise four loose front teeth. I saw how the dentist constantly and carefully refined the denture using a motor drill to ensure it fit comfortably in the patient's mouth, highlighting the problem-solving aspect of dentistry and the manual precision it demands. The dentist then asked a senior consultant to assess the denture and give a second opinion. The senior consultant's genuine willingness to assist was evident as she offered thorough feedback to the dentist while instilling confidence in their work. This exemplified effective collaboration within the multidisciplinary team to achieve patient-centred care, a clear display of GDC principle 6. Similarly, participating in interschool maths competitions has enhanced my ability to work and lead effectively within a team, which parallels the cohesive teamwork integral to dental settings.\n\nBeyond academics, practicing crochet and guitar in my free time has not only provided an outlet for stress, but has also improved my manual dexterity which is crucial when performing intricate tasks in confined spaces. Jiujitsu trains me to problem-solve quickly under pressure; this is an essential skill in dentistry, where varied conditions require tailored solutions daily. I recognise the physical and mental demands of this course, however to me the reward of restoring the health and confidence of patients massively outweighs these challenges.",

    "statement_full_text": "Studying architecture offers a rare intersection of scientific and creative disciplines. Studying at a UTC has equipped me with a solid foundation in STEM, strengthened by collaborative, employer-led projects. Yet, I have felt the absence of a creative outlet, a space where my passions for science and art coexist; architecture is an interdisciplinary field, where analytical thinking unites with aesthetic intent.\n\nWhilst learning about STEM principles within architecture, I was drawn to Calatrava's Mediopadana. The trigonometric waves formed by its steel portals inspired me, and I wondered how this was modelled during the design process. This drove to me research the capabilities of parametric modelling- where varying inputs generate calculated outputs, allowing for faster paced, adaptable design. Curious about its real-world uses, I learnt the foundation of parametrics by designing a saw handle on Fusion 360. Familiarising myself with CAD confirmed my ambition of using innovative technologies within contemporary practice and reinforced my desire to study architecture.\n\nA pivotal moment in my understanding of design was the National Theatre's 'Stagecraft' project that I completed during my Product Design course. I created a model for 'The Grapes of Wrath,' which offered a unique way to develop my skills working in a reduced scale, and a chance to tell a story through design choices. I was recognised for conveying the timeless, enduring injustice in the play by using ambiguity and minimalism to direct focus onto the actors. This project was my first investigation of the human effects of aesthetics and taught me that design, even at miniature sizes, can be utilised to influence viewers' emotions.\n\nThis curiosity about the psychological impacts of space led me to Alain de Botton's 'The Architecture of Happiness.' His critiques of Corbusier's impersonal style of modernism, and insistence that architecture should reflect the values of the time and location in which we build, deeply resonated with me. I applied Botton's thinking to my coursework, designing luxury furniture honouring a local metal working firm's heritage. My analysis of the company's dynamic past will be applied to my piece, materialising his writing by physically embodying the evolving values of the company through convertibility and multi-functionality.\n\nTwo summer schools broadened my expectations of university study. In Sheffield, I explored urban regeneration, selecting a building from the skyline and proposing a new use for the space- an exercise in line with sustainable approaches to adaptive reuse which I encountered at UTC Leeds: a former press-working factory remodelled into a college. At St John's, Cambridge, I designed a temporary pavilion; I was inspired by Chinese tourism in the area, so referenced cultural motifs and provided exhibition spaces for local Asian artists. My aim was to celebrate the history of Asian figures in the city and emphasise the talents of underrepresented voices.\n\nAttending UKREIFF expanded my understanding of architecture's social responsibility. Notably, a workshop led by BDP Leeds explored inclusive design for neurodiverse and disabled people, with Southmead Hospital as a case study. Its use of natural light, ventilation, and intuitive way finding, exemplified how architecture should prioritise users' needs, which strongly aligns with my interest in human centric design.\n\nThis October, I will undertake a placement with Watson Batty, shadowing professionals and working on an independent project. I hope to consolidate what I have learnt thus far, putting it into practice in a professional setting, and growing my skills in drawing and model making.\n\nCollectively, these experiences have formed my view of architecture and its wide-reaching impact on engineering, environment, and emotion. I am looking forward to deepening my knowledge in an academic setting, and growing my technical skill set, to design meaningful and responsive buildings.",

    "statement_full_text": "I am fascinated by other cultures, whether they be present-day or historical. I have found that, despite the at times acrimonious Anglo-Franco relationship, the French culture offers rich historical and linguistic insight into the formation of its neighbouring nation. Reading an article from the University of Nottingham highlighted to me the impact of the French language on English lexis: dating back to the arrival of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy and remaining entrenched in modern day vocabulary. I reinforced my understanding of the significance of language exchange by exploring the need for greater levels of bilingualism in the UK in my EPQ.\n\nWhen staying with host families on French and Spanish exchanges, I was able to see the effects of history abroad and particularly how the taboo of the Vichy Regime persists in French societal attitudes. This challenged the impression I had formed from literature and film (A. Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See) and non-fiction (In the Mouth of the Wolf — a play about French SOE officer Francis Cammaerts) which presented to me a venerated misconstruction that wartime France was united in resistance to Nazi occupation. Exploring the subtleties of France's ambiguous association with both the Allies and Axis powers inspired me to complete my own research project on F. Cammaerts and enter the YHA essay competition with my findings. I was particularly enthralled by Cammaerts' almost paradoxical determination to asseverate his pacifism whilst organising guerilla warfare on behalf of the allies. Yet, I questioned the typicality of this individual's compelling story and so will be researching the extent of French collaboration and resistance in WW2 further in my History NEA.\n\nReading verse such as Paroles by Prévert has heightened my appreciation for the lilting euphonies of the French language, whilst reading Les Justes by Camus and consequently L'Étranger has helped me become more accustomed to the syntax of real-life French. Tackling French philosophy (Cinq Méditations Sur la Beauté by F. Cheng) has reminded me of the boundless levels of academia that language learning provides and motivated me to pursue a more sophisticated command of the language. Maths A-Level has instilled in me the rigour of learning and applying formulae, which is necessary for language acquisition.\n\nWhen reading historical literature such as A Line in the Sand by J. Barr and Lawrence of Arabia by R. Fiennes, in advance of my Y13 Middle East unit, it was intriguing to notice the disparities in the authors' interpretations, in which Fiennes presented a somewhat discourteous glorification of Britain, France, and the USA's political disenfranchisement of the Arabs. Similarly, when visiting the San Francisco City Museum, I was struck by the disingenuous treatment of the Chinese population during the creation of the transcontinental railroad, who were omitted from history by the White settlers, despite making up 90% of the workforce. This seemed staggering for such a seemingly righteous country, in comparison to the vast progression of justice and enlightenment a century earlier in Germany, which I learnt about on the languages 'Access to Bristol' course.\n\nTo improve my oral skills, I listen to podcasts such as Escargot and HugoDécrypte, which I have then been able to exercise by winning the SW languages debating competition and spending a week working in a library in France. In doing the latter, I observed the centrality of stories, both historical and fictional, to the local municipality and was reminded of the escapism that exploring alternate narratives provides. I recognised the importance of local, individual stories by reading History: A Very Short Introduction and by volunteering at my local Heritage Centre. In my café job, I have grown to value communication when managing staff and customers. Similarly, this principle has been key for me when mentoring younger students in French and Spanish and also for 11+ exams.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nMathematics is widely considered the sole universal language, underpinning everything we do and explaining the world we live in. It transcends geographical or cultural boundaries and unifies people in a way that inspires me. I came to really appreciate the subject during my accelerated study of the A-Level in one year; the rigour and beauty of it is unlike anything. Uncovering new links between concepts, experiencing the light-bulb moment where everything clicks and then finding a new pathway to solve a problem is truly addictive.\n\nThe further you study, the more you see how important the basics are. Pascal's Triangle seemed to be nothing more than a trivial array of numbers to my 11-year-old self, but I felt enlightened when I saw how this could be applied in several real-world places, like as the binomial coefficients in statistics to find probability with repeated trials.\n\nI'm fascinated with how mathematical ideas appear in the most unexpected of places. One example is 'Dudley's Happiness Function', created by microeconomist Dr Julia Shvets – a model to find the optimal driving speed which maximises joy and minimises pain. Some would call this common sense, but I found using maths in such an everyday scenario to be satisfying.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies prepared you for this course or subject?\n\nCompleting the entirety of A-Level mathematics in Year 12 strengthened my resolve, preparing me for the university pace. Learning topics at this speed fulfilled my desire to absorb all the knowledge I could, oftentimes leading me to explore further than the specification. For example, I was nominated to sit the Mathematical Olympiad for Girls which had styles of problems I had never encountered before, such as a combinatorics question on which I gained full marks. It felt invigorating to be faced with such intensive questions and attempt several different approaches until one worked. This led me to read Robin Wilson's 'A Very Short Introduction to Combinatorics', where I discovered an interest in enumeration problems and was surprised by how this links to my study of isomerism in A-Level Chemistry.\n\nFor my Industrial Cadets Gold Award, I led the mathematical component within my team to build a tidal energy generator. I was responsible for the gear system, calculating tidal speeds from data I sourced from the local harbour, and determining the optimal gear ratio. After many of my initial ideas failed, the genuine rush of finding the perfect solution is exactly what drives my passion for tackling new problems. Applying maths to address prevalent problems faced by our society, with environmentalism coming increasingly to the forefront, really inspired me with what I could do in the future.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education and why were these experiences useful?\n\nIn Cambridge's Women in Maths Programme, Dr Henry Bradford's lecture on algorithmic methods to find new large primes sparked my interest in RSA cryptography. I found it intriguing, albeit concerning as with advances in quantum computing, the process of factorising large primes from a product could be done alarmingly quickly, thus putting our banking, emails and overall privacy at great risk.\n\nI wrote an article for my school's science magazine on the prevailing debate whether maths was invented or discovered, including my further research on primes. The North American Periodical Cicada only ever lives a prime number of years, ensuring their emergence rarely coincides with that of their predators. In my eyes, this is an explicit display of maths embedded innately in nature and not something that mankind can begin to fabricate.\n\nTutoring GCSE maths students showed me how explaining basic concepts from different angles can offer new insights, even to people who mastered them years ago. Being able to cater your teachings to help different types of minds understand has been rewarding for me.",
