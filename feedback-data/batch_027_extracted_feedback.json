    "statement_full_text": "Murphy's Law states: anything that can go wrong, eventually will. Yet, in a world full of unpredictability, engineering provides me with the tools to find precision within uncertainty. It provides a gateway to facilitate my affinity for problem-solving, fusing theoretical knowledge with practical application, all whilst I'm challenged to turn limitations into innovation.\n\nThis concept became clear to me while writing an academic essay for the Women Who Soar competition at Queen Mary University regarding future sustainable technology. I researched the paradigm shift electric propulsion systems could bring to the aviation industry, given their higher specific impulse and the potential to source energy for these systems from renewable sources like solar power. I learned how the laws of thermodynamics apply to electric propulsion systems, where limitations imposed by the second law show that there will be inevitable energy dispersal as heat. Engineering is crucial to minimise entropy production within processes to get closer to optimal efficiency rates during system design in order to increase sustainability.  \n\n\nIn an independent research project conducted with the EDT, I investigated the engineering trade-offs inherent in the design of Formula 1 cars, centred on the compromise between reducing drag and maximising speed. The F1 rear wing is shaped as an inverted airfoil to force incoming air downwards and create a pressure difference, thereby generating downforce as outlined in Bernoulli's principle. By increasing the angle of attack, the downforce can be maximised, but large angles lead to airflow separation and drag, as explored in the book \"Race Car Aerodynamics: Designing for Speed\" by Joseph Katz. From this, I understand engineering as the study of the relationships between the modules of a system, which has cultivated my view of design and testing. \n\nI explored this notion further in an academic poster competition with Oriel College, Oxford. I researched turbomachinery, how each element is meticulously designed to optimise efficiently by itself, whilst operating cohesively to exchange energy with the working fluids, and features such as turbine cooling and end-wall contouring. But, most notably, the history behind the iconic steam engine. Charles Parson succeeded by cleverly combining the actions of the Hero's engine and Giovanni Branca's boiler to create the revolutionary turbine. He used the impulse force of the steam as seen in Branca's device to rotate the wheels and the reaction of the aerophile by affixing a set of stationary wheels to the casing instead of the rotating shaft after each wheel to redirect the steam and impinge the next wheel. Yet most interestingly, he took into account the failures of both inventions by using 30 wheels to avoid the destructive speed seen in each one. This showed me that engineering succeeds through synergy and the application of collective knowledge. This is what Guru Madhaban in \"Think like an engineer\" identifies as the core of the engineering mindset- modular systems thinking. It is not a singular talent, but a mélange of techniques and principles that give rise to effective solutions. Through this course, I hope to collaborate with other 'inference engines' (as described by Madhaban) from multiple disciplines who seek to create a positive impact on society through the application of engineering principles.\n\nI have always sought the direct application of maths in my engineering endeavours. For example, while working towards the Silver CREST award in the Engineering Experience Programme at the SFTC, I applied mathematical techniques to create an algorithm in Python capable of distinguishing stars from galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey dataset to train my model. I began with a linear model using the least squares method in an attempt to minimise the residual errors between the data points and the fitted model. To do this, I implemented the mean squared error formula to account for the errors. However, I determined that non-linear classification needed to be used, and the textbook 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning' introduced me to how models such as logistic regression can classify data by mapping inputs onto a sigmoid function. I learned about normalisation and how a decision boundary is determined, which sparked questions about how the algorithm's weighing system can be adjusted during training to improve data normalisation. Upon analysing the results, I found that most data points were being incorrectly classified as stars, but I came to see these errors not as failures but as clues. In Why Things Break, Mark Eberhart describes how fractures and breakdowns in materials reveal the principles that govern their behaviour. I found a parallel in my own project: each misclassification of my algorithm exposed the limitations of my approach and suggested how to improve it, leading me to increase the influence of stars to skew the model towards them. As theorised, the number of incorrectly identified stars decreased significantly. To push myself further, I used NumPy to iteratively change the combination of weights for the model to find the best parameters for the weighted sum. The MIT lecture on \"gradient descent\" allowed me to find the best alternative weight combination for prediction by minimising the log loss function. This experience taught me to embrace the iterative process of refining solutions- an outlook I am eager to apply in engineering.",

    "statement_full_text": "Growing up around a relative who struggled with leukaemia, I saw him endure years of palliative care, revealing to me the research gap in tackling relapses and treatment resistance. During a shadowing stint at a pathology lab, I found it immensely gratifying to learn about how antibody-antigen principles in immunohistochemistry extend into immunophenotyping used in diagnosing blood disorders like leukaemia. I was encouraged to think more deeply about how laboratory techniques translate into clinical application to aid disease diagnosis and treatment planning, cultivating my determination to contribute to more effective therapies through translational research to overcome treatment challenges. This passion was reinforced when preparing for a debate on precision medicine, where I came across Sidney Farber's early antifolate trials. His perseverance through repeated failures before the first leukaemia remissions inspired me/further solidified my desire to approach research with the same commitment. Enrolling in an 'Introductory to Genomic Data Science Specialization' online course by Johns Hopkins University has exposed me to the relevance of computational tools like Python and R in testing statistical significance to validate research findings. I ran a Python t-test using fold-change resistance values from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database to deduce the positive correlation between thymidine analogue mutation frequency and decreased efficacy of dolutegravir, which made me reflect on the limitations in current ART regimens. From this I deepened my understanding of the quantitative aspects of biological research, while developing my aptitude to critically analyse data. My curiosity in other potential treatment methods landed me on an article about 'The Berlin Patient'. The first ever successful instance of stem cell transplant of donor cells with CCR5 mutation has led to my further analysis in how stem cell therapy and gene editing could potentially overcome drug resistance issues in a more scalable and safer way. tHIS ASEAN 2025, a health summit I attended exposed me to many groundbreaking medical technologies. I was introduced to an implantable drug delivery system, which made me realise the medical shift in emphasis towards patient adherence. I was reminded of an A-Level Biology topic on drug-resistant TB and its correlation with medication adherence issues, inspiring me to write an article about how long-acting injectable drug delivery systems could optimise TB treatment for my college's research club. I mainly explained the concept of 'zero-order release kinetics' in maintaining a constant plasma drug level within therapeutic ranges, where I had to simplify the mathematics of pharmacokinetics into comprehensible language, sharpening my abilities to convey ideas scientifically. This project has well equipped me with the writing and research skills needed for scientific essay writing at university level. Being an active volunteer at health screening programs for National Cancer Society Malaysia (NCSM), working with a multidisciplinary team is part of the journey. I made sure each member understands our common goal in addition to their respective roles by encouraging honest discussions, demonstrating my recognition of the need for teamwork in a collaborative setting. Training as an assistant counsellor for Pap smear screening at NCSM also honed my ability to deliver technical information to patients and improved my communication skills, a skill that will be necessary for participating in scientific discourse among my peers and lecturers. Beyond academics, I turn to crocheting as a way to destress. From weaving yarns through tiny gaps to retracing rows of yarn due to a misplaced stitch, the meticulous nature of crocheting has reinforced my attention to detail and capability to spot errors quickly, crucial for lab work. I believe these experiences have equipped me with the foundation and necessary skills to grow and contribute meaningfully through this degree, launching me to opportunities in translational research.",

    "statement_full_text": "Section 1\nWhy do you want to study this course or subject? Interests and passions. \nA BBC article brought to my attention the disruptions to ecosystems now occurring with climate change: new species such as bluefin tuna and octopus are encroaching into UK waters with just a 0.2ºC increase in sea temperatures since 1980. Wanting more, I attended a lecture by the Northumberland IFCA detailing the effects of rising sea temperatures on sea bass behaviour and spawning locations. Curious as to the physiological effects that had so impacted fish behaviour, I found a study in the 'International Journal of Natural Sciences'. It seems higher temperatures increase metabolic rates, reducing resources available for reproduction, and fluctuations cause disruption to hormone signalling. This reduces sperm motility and hatch rates. In response, bass have spawned farther north each year. I was in awe of how such a tiny rise in temperature could have such far-reaching impacts. This drove my aspiration to study and research climate change as I believe no other phenomenon will have effects on life so radical.\nSection 2\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject? \nTaking interest in the immune system at AS level, I was curious about the body's defences against other threats. Read 'Oxygen' (Lane, 2002), I was enraptured by the content on the evolution and workings of defence systems against free oxygen radicals. The complex roles of antioxidants like vitamin C, which can promote oxidation with the presence of free iron or copper, forced me to reconsider whether any substance has a simple effect on the body. Similarly, 'Oxygen' gave me a deeper understanding of genetics by introducing to me antagonistic pleiotropy. It seems few genes have a straightforward or wholly beneficial effect. This highlighted two limitations of evolution—the time taken to adapt to new selective pressures, and the persistence of negative traits tied to beneficial ones. This has forced me to be humble and open to ideas that contradict my preconceptions.\nCompleting my EPQ on maritime law has made me very confident in my writing, deconstruction of complex arguments and critical evaluation. I researched the maritime disputes in the South China Sea, where many of the case studies involved ecological damage. Researching the legislature surrounding MPAs and environmental stewardship highlighted the vital role of international agreements such as UNCLOS. Consequently, I've developed an appreciation for the necessity of political action alongside scientific advancement for effective conservation. \nLeft curious about ongoing examples, I was led to a Scientific American article on the political and cultural barriers to ending Pika culls in China, which made clear that poor science communication was perpetuating the practice. Clearly education is another essential component to conservation. Investigating the wider ecological impacts of the culls, I found a study in the Journal of Mammalogy on the dietary plasticity of Pallas's cats (Whose primary prey is the pika). I learnt how dietary plasticity can be indicative of resilience to changing food sources and was introduced to Optimal Foraging Theory. This model evaluates the effort/risk vs. reward of obtaining a food source. These concepts deepened my understanding of what makes hunting strategy successful: specialisation can be efficient but has left the cats over reliant on a vulnerable food source. Reading texts like these in my spare time and for my EPQ has made me more confident in navigating scholarly sources, understanding research methodology and identifying bias.\nSection 3\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful? \nRunning my school's maths and science societies and serving as a mentor for chemistry, I have learnt to communicate complex ideas engagingly and effectively – crucial in research, essays and presentations. A member of my school's culture and film clubs, I enjoy reading, drawing and watching films; art is grounding and fosters emotive and creative thought.\nBeyond academics, I am a young leader for my local scout troop, volunteering weekly to help organise activities, run sessions and support the younger members of the group where needed. More personally to me, I find no better way than spending time hiking, camping, and fishing to witness nature and deepen my appreciation. It is something one innately feels a part of and this drives my desire to understand and protect it.",

I witnessed these same products used on a boy injured in a football game at the next door orphanage. I also saw a reverse osmosis operation providing clean water for a whole village. I have shadowed drug production at GSK and seen the necessity for electric vehicles repeated by countless experts. Beyond my fascination in its theory,  I believe chemistry's true worth is in its application to serve humanity.\n\n\nI have greatly enjoyed chemistry A-level, which has shown me the breadth of the subject. I was drawn to the electrochemistry topic, and this inspired me to produce a research report for Caius Explore on the future of battery sustainability, which I concluded lies with solid-state batteries. I found the redox principles of this topic fascinating and enjoyed the interlinking of chemistry and physics. I explored this marriage further by producing an essay on electronic structure inspired by 'why chemical reactions happen', expanding on my a-level knowledge of quantum physics and orbitals to explore wave functions. This demonstrated to me also the heavily mathematical nature of chemistry, a skill I have developed in the A-level and showed in the UKMT senior mathematical challenge, in which I received a gold. This bestowed the skill of problem solving in a mathematical context which I applied to the RSC chemistry Olympiad and C3L6, receiving a silver and gold award. These exams were uniquely challenging , introducing new topics within them, and I enjoyed their intellectually probing nature. One such new topic to me was NMR, which I then learnt the theory behind after the exam. I found the link in the form of spin pairing with my research into electronic orbitals exciting, . This new knowledge allowed me to analyse the NMR spectrum of a carboxylate synthesised at a work experience.\n\nCurious to gain lab experience I took part in the RSC schools' analyst challenge, involving redox titrations and TLC chromatography, through which I gained collaboration and critical thinking skills. To develop these skills further, I took part in the Colour Chemistry Workshop at the Royal Institution which involved designing my own experiment to analyse paint samples. I especially enjoyed using more sophisticated lab technologies there, such as micropipettes, and was curious how they scaled up on the industrial scale. This led me to do a chemistry work experience placement at GSK, gaining an insight into various chemical departments such as process chemistry. The contrast between the HPLC displayed there and the rudimentary TLC I had used, as well as the robots who could pipette 96 samples in the time that I would fumble with one micropipette sample astounded me. The medicinal chemistry department also showed me an amide coupling reaction and mechanism, which inspired me to complete an academic research poster for the St Johns' College Poster Competition on methotrexate, a drug whose synthesis involves the reaction, and its oncological role. To end the week, I presented my findings on gel electrophoresis from the chemical biology lab to an audience of employees and students, a uniquely nerve-racking yet enjoyable opportunity, contrasting with my role as chemistry editor for my school science journal as my viewers were not behind a wall of text. Being a maths mentor for a year has given me practice at breaking down concepts for others, in turn improving my ability to make complex ideas more digestible for myself. I developed this skill when I was teaching chemistry lessons in Kenta to students aged from 7-19, often introducing the subject from scratch which tested and consolidated my fundamental understanding of the subject. Telling those younger pupils that everything was made from atoms reminded me of chemistry's ubiquity and remarkable nature.",

However, in Power's 'A Problem from Hell', Raphael Lempkin's lifelong struggle to build a legal tool against genocide evoked in me feelings of frustration when met with political inaction. Wendt's \"Anarchy is what states make of it\" to understand why moral rhetoric consistently failed to match action. While identity conflicts (US's identity as global liberator vs global hegemon) help to explain the contradictions, I question why states choose one identity over the other. I am eager to explore how other theories like realism could answer this.  \n\nWatching TLDR News' video on Kenya's Anti-IMF protests led me to read Woods' 'The Globalizers' . It revealed how the IMF and World Bank's institutional architecture could lead to outcomes that contradict their developmental goals. She critiques how structural adjustment policies adversely reduced the quantity and quality of social services for the poor in Africa. I believe that prioritising the improvement of material standard of living is necessary yet, I wonder how these institutions can better balance economic stability and human welfare.  \n\nPPE's interdisciplinary approach provides me with the skills to tackle questions I developed from my readings: ethical frameworks for equitable development, political theories of institutional change and cost-benefit analysis to assess policy impact. \n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject? \n\nEngaging with current affairs for General Paper  has prepared me for PPE through exposure to multidimensional issues and diverse perspectives. Writing an essay on the feasibility of universal health coverage, I compared how Singapore's Medisave used co-payments to balance moral hazards with communitarian ethics. Yet, post-2011 conflict in Sudan exemplified Acemoglu's extractive institutions – elite capture by Khartoum's military complex diverting resources from healthcare. Sen's \"development as freedom\" provided a framework to understand why this was problematic – how Sudan's extractive institutions systematically denied his five freedoms for decades. I concluded that UHC feasibility depends on institutional quality, a tension I wish to explore in PPE \n\nIn H3 Economics, I initially struggled with understanding how technology as an endogenous variable resolved Solow's long-term growth gap. Using Python from CS50P and QuantEcon to graph Solow's convergence to a steady state, implying per capita growth slows with capital accumulation. I contrasted this to empirical data – Singapore's sustained high annual GDP growth resulting from the government's focus on human capital. While endogenous drivers of growth in Romer's model helped me understand Singapore's sustained growth, Acemoglu suggests how inclusive institutions enable such policies. Resolving this gap revealed the limitations of Solow's model to institutional factors, igniting my interest in empirical validation. This led me to take the World Bank's \"Evaluating Impact\" course, learning causal methods like Difference-in-Differences. I will apply these analytical skills to PPE's quantitative curriculum. \n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of formal education, and why are these experiences useful?  \n\nThe situation in Gaza made me ask how wars can be conducted justly, leading me to Walzer's principle of proportionality in \"Just and Unjust Wars\". This prompted me to question a strategy known as the Dahiya doctrine – targeting centres of civilian power to encourage civil disobedience – for its moral justifiability. I saw a similar issue in Arendt's \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" where she critiques Israel's kidnapping of Eichmann to Israel: the tension between a morally desired end, and the legal and ethical constraints on the means used to achieve it.  While I agree that justice should be enacted, the methods by which it was done seemed illegal. Analysing issues through conflicting theoretical lenses is a skill I am keen to develop further in PPE to explore the tension between legality and legitimacy.",
