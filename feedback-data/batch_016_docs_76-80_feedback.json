In my time there, I witnessed in real-time the children's growth and changes, in such a distinct environment to accommodate different learning needs best. With some of the children being disabled, neurodiverse, or otherwise \"different\" from others, this sparked my lasting curiosity to understand the difference: Why do some children seem to struggle with communication or routine, while others formed friendships or grasped language concepts at different paces? And in some cases, what makes these children faster learners than their peers, despite additional challenges? These questions led me to search for answers in my own time, looking towards developmental psychology for a better understanding.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject? - 1612\nMy interest in studying politics at university began when I watched a Finacial Times documentary about Brexit. It touched on how many people regretted their vote in the 2016 Referendum because they lacked information about the economic effects of Brexit. This piqued my interest in politics because I wish to understand the mechanisms that allow democracy to work and how a phenomenon like this was able to be. Because this documentary allowed me to understand the importance of being informed about politics, I joined some youth groups which include the Westminster Youth Council, UNA Climate and Oceans, and UNAYP. These groups taught me how to actively engage in youth issues and I seek to use what I learnt to study politics at university.\n\nQuestion 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nI recently attended a taster course about the resurgence of fascism and I learnt about many thinkers, including Adorno and Reich, and their theories on why fascism is rising in popularity. As a result, I intend for my independent research project in German to be about evaluating the usefulness of Wilhem Reich's ideas to explain the rising popularity of the AfD in Germany. This project will contribute to the scholarly understanding of contemporary political movements while developing critical analytical skills essential for advanced political studies. I found keen interest in Reich's work about the link between fascism and sexual repression so that led me to do some reading into sociologist Foucault's book about the history of sexuality. Foucault's critique conveys the evolving nature of political discourse and highlights the importance of critical analysis. Building on my interest in the factors contributing to fascist movements, my EPQ on Colombian drug cartels also explored the role of many multifaceted factors that resulted in their sustained control over Colombia. Firstly the research element of the project has given me the citation and evaluation skills needed to do well on a politics course. I have also gained insight on how important historical context will be when analysing contemporary politics at university. My research showed that Colombia's history of violence between the liberals and conservatives left the country unstable and drug cartels were able to take advantage of that. This led me to read the book 'Why Nations Fail' as the book was briefly spoken about in my economics class so I knew it would link well to my EPQ.\n\nQuestion 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nDue to my interest in how poltical ideas manifest in society, I visited the Royal Courts of Justice. One case that stuck out to me was Okpabi et al. v Royal Dutch Shell plc et al. It set important precedent for international corporate liability and it was useful for me to see how some countries have heavy influence over other countries through transnational corporations. This realisation inspired me to take part in Immerse Education's essay competition about how countries use their cultural and economic influence to achieve political goals. This experience taught me about media imperialism, which I found interesting as I do notice how US culture is embedded in almost every level of society, like through film and music.",
