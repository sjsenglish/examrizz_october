    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study Political Economy?\n\nKnowing how incentives build social value or lead to collective inefficiencies intrigues me. An example I've seen: Asian Marriage Markets.\n\nParents see people as commodities, whose value later depreciates, and rush to match suitors early, making the market congested. This means too many compete for the same resource simultaneously, despite having incomplete information, leading to worse matches and market inefficiency, as parents hastily accept any match. This shows how perverse incentives (parents' fears) lead to market failure. The adverse effect cultural norms have on systems like marriage makes me interested in political economy.\n\nRoth's Who Gets What & Why, taught me how mechanism design adapts incentives in systems to achieve social benefits. I learnt how to fix congested markets e.g. lawyer internships, where early matches lead to inefficiency, by reducing incentives to match early/encouraging people to go later, building trust and cooperation. However, I found limits e.g. public opposition and cheating, reveal gaps between policies' viability and economic design, drawing me into political economy.\n\nI wish to study institutional design, incentives and Game Theory in political economy to tackle tyranny of the majority (where majority preference exceeds minorities') and rentierism (where monopolistic land ownership reduces allocative efficiency, driving inequality).\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for Political Economy?\n\nDittrich's 2007 paper, taught me the value of the Kalai Smorodinsky Solution (KSS) in wage negotiations. This is a bargaining tool used to share scarce resources relative to people's desires rather than an equal split.\n\nI learnt that in dual labour markets, where unions negotiate wages with KSS vs firms using Nash bargaining, using the KSS can lead to higher employment and fairer wages. This is because workers face pay increases relative to the firm's profits and their bargaining power, leading to less strikes, and productivity gains. However, I think the KSS ignores information asymmetry in large labour markets as firms may know more about profits than workers.\n\nLater, I wrote about Game Theory in Rocket League (RL). It is a game where players compete, taking a share of the field in positioning. Information gaps between teammates make sharing this resource hard. I designed a bidding mechanism for sharing space on the field, so each player's preference is revealed and respected, leading to better resource allocation. Learning information revelation and fair institutional design drives me towards political economy.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nCH2 Radical Markets introduced me to Weyl's Quadratic Voting (QV) in elections. He argues QV makes it cost more to use more votes, so only those passionate and educated on issues vote on them. While he assumes voters are rationally passionate, I believe misinformation sways intensity of preference. Uneducated voters passionate about Brexit will choose to spend votes on this, so most will vote for Brexit, expanding tyranny of the majority. Policymakers have little incentive to promote QV, as a one person one vote system preserves their power, so Weyl may face dissent, unless he can align incentives. I wish to study incentive alignment, public and social choice theory in political economy.\n\nRichard Green's paper Elecxit led me to electricity-market coupling and how Brexit disrupted UK-EU integration. My key finding was that Brexit halting automatic electricity transfer meant UK-EU power stations failed to transmit/receive correct amounts, causing €300m+ dynamic losses, due to risk-averse investors, showing me the limits of social choice on electricity markets\n\nInterviewing him on nationalising British energy improved my knowledge of how political economy concepts e.g. government minimum price buffers reduce investor risk in asset ownership.",

This seemingly revealed a trend where policymakers favour politically simple, short-term control over complex long-term investment in welfare. My suspicions were aroused further after learning from DC Black's 2021 Review of Drugs, Part Two, that while the total cost to society of illegal drugs is £20 bn annually, only £650m was spent on treatment and prevention. This is despite the fact that every £1 spent on harm reduction and treatment gave a combined return on investment of £4. Amazed by this misallocation of resources, I wanted to find out why economically viable policies are discarded for more politically favourable ones by studying politics & economics at university.\n\nQ2\n\nTo begin with, Roth's work on repugnant markets showed me how social opposition may block efficient but taboo solutions. I thought this was best applicable to debates regarding asylum seekers in the UK. Despite findings from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that allowing them to work would increase tax revenue by £1.3bn and reduce government spending by £6.7bn, this has been blocked by policymakers. It was the dilemma of integrating politics into market design which led me to Shengwu Li's stance: informed neutrality between reasonable ethical positions and focusing on objective goals like efficiency in market design. Although I agree that objective goals should be prioritised, the act of defining \"reasonable ethical positions is not neutral. Thus, market designers can not be neutral in practice and must consider social norms and fairness.\n\nApplying mechanism design to social choice debates, I came across Weyl's Radical Markets, which proposes using Quadratic Voting (QV) in elections. He argues that QV means it costs quadratically more to cast votes, so only those who feel truly intensely about an issue will vote on it and internalise the social cost caused by their vote. However, I believe that misinformation can distort intensity of preference on topical issues like immigration and so undermines QV's outcomes and efficiency. Weyl theoretically assumes intensity of preference to be an exogenous variable, when it is in reality often endogenous. This was echoed by Kaplow & Kominers' 2017 paper, which argued social movements and misconceptions can make voters act irrationally under QV. I wish to use econometrics at university to consider the effect external actors can have on voter rationality in public choice settings.\n\nQ3\n\nInterviewing Prof. Richard Green of Imperial on the impacts on consumers and firms of building Sizewell C introduced me to the Regulated Asset Base Model (RAB): Ownership is used for projects like Sizewell C, where investors are given a fixed return, as consumers absorb construction costs. However, he argued that this would not use a cost-plus model, and the government would have to compensate investors while protecting consumers by agreeing on a fair energy price. From this, I now realise the role the government plays in reducing risk among investors and maintaining social welfare, which I wish to explore further in politics & economics.\n\nParticipating in a one-week UNIQ PPE taster course at Oxford University, where I attended lectures and wrote essays on utilitarianism, familiarised me with university-level work and improved my essay writing and time management skills. Moreover, St James's Place's wealth management work experience taught me how behavioural economics affected investment decisions and the key analytical skills that I will need to engage with political and economic theory. Participating in charity camping via Scouts has deepened my devotion to outreach as I aspire to be a leading member of my university community.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nWhat makes a decision rational: its intention, its outcome, or its impact on others?\nWhen considering the field of economics, there are underlying assumptions of ceteris paribus and rational economic agents acting in their best interests. However, in reality, this may not true. This piqued my interest in behavioural economics, in particular, how logic gaps contradict the idea of rationality, which underpins all economic theories. What intrigues me the most is how firms are monetising these biases to shape consumer preference to maximise sales.\nReading Kahneman's \"Thinking Fast and Slow\", I was surprised to see the frequency at which we succumb to our cognitive biases. Kahneman redefined human decision making into two systems: the fast, intuitive System 1 and the slow, analytical System 2. I was particularly interested in how System 1 uses heuristics such as anchoring to influence their decisions. Listening to Freakonomics Radio, I was introduced to left digit bias, a form of anchoring where consumers fixate on the left-most digit. This leads to irrational differences in perceived value, challenging the classical economic assumption of rationality. Having independently studied Prospect Theory, I was convinced that consumers' decisions were driven by the fear of losing. Professor Abeler's research paper \"Reference Points and Effort Provision\" was able to give key insights into how this was the case. The paper demonstrated the role of loss aversion when it came to behaviour. People are motivated when they are expected to fall short of a target, often leading to choices influenced more by emotion than logic. When applying this to society, I have seen how firms leverage loss aversion through limited- time deals to encourage impulsive purchases and ultimately, these maximise profit.\nIn exploring the intersection between behavioural economics and economic history, I researched key historical events that highlighted the limitations of rationality. After listening to an LSE podcast \"Ten Years after the Crisis\", I was fascinated by the role herd behaviour played in the Financial Crisis. Investors were mimicking the actions of others, rather than their own independent analysis creating asset bubbles and the collapse of the market. This gives an insight into how psychological factors can affect market outcomes. What was most interesting is how the Financial Crisis echoes previous events, leading to the same devastating economic consequences. \nI look forward to exploring consumer behaviour and historical economic patterns in the  behavioural economics module.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nMathematics is an important foundation for economics. I find it extremely rewarding when applying mathematical models to abstract economic theories to form empirical results. Having read \"Mathematics for Economics and Finance\" by Anthony and Biggs introduced me to the Lagrange Multiplier method- a technique to maximise profit when facing constraints from the basic problem of scarcity. By measuring the value of relaxing these constraints, firms can gain an insight into how much additional profit could be made. I find it fascinating how firms can use this concept to succeed in a market, through applying real world limitations such as regulations and budgets, often disregarded in traditional economic theory. From a profit-maximising perspective, firms are able to create mathematical models which are adapted for innate consumer biases such as accounting for their elasticity in the Third-Degree Price Discrimination. I am particularly interested in how managerial styles are influenced by a firm's ambitious goals with practical outcomes centred around data and models. To further my understanding, I attended lectures at the Marshall Conference 2025 at the University of Cambridge, including one given by Professor Nejra van Zalk on Surveillance Capitalism. Her arguments further challenged what I had previously learnt – firms tactically nudge consumers to their products. Surveillance Capitalism is utilised by firms to tailor advertisements and create an echo chamber to shape the decisions of consumers, demonstrating a trend towards a digital economy. Firms are beginning to focus on digital surveillance as a profitable model to influence the public in a certain direction irrespective of rationality. \nEconomic theory can help to explain the political climate of a country. I was selected for the University of Bath's Economics Pathway where I regularly participated in online lectures on macroeconomic concepts. My dissertation on the comparative analysis of government responses to the COVID -19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine War, and their impacts on national economies received a First Class Honours. I applied the IS-LM model to assess shifts in economic performance during each crisis with particular emphasis on inflation and consumer uncertainty, learning how both the pandemic and war impacted economies differently via demand and supply respectively. I was shocked to learn the vulnerability of larger economies due to their interdependence on each other. This drives my study into past economic events how they inform current decision making. \n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nOver the past year, I have been working independently towards a Level 2 Fundamentals in Financial Services qualification by the CISI, for which I achieved 28/30. I have expanded my knowledge about key financial instruments, for example, bonds, equities and derivatives. During my insight day at CitiBank, I was able to examine the use of these instruments and risk management strategies used by the firm when executing a trade. I observed the purchase of a forward for a French bond deepening my interest in how management strategically balances risk and profit for themselves and the client. \nI enjoyed competing in the UKMT Senior Mathematics Challenge achieving a Gold Award. The Ritangle 2024 Competition was an opportunity for me to apply my coding skills to weekly mathematics problems, where I led my team to the final stage. I have been successful in both individual and team-based competitions, developing a skill set suitable for the various styles of university-level studying. \nMy role as Vice Chair within the Finance Committee, in particular, launching an initiative for Year 12 students, gave me an opportunity to consolidate my understanding of economic concepts when presenting these to fellow students, for which I received positive feedback from both teachers and students. I have also gained a certificate for Bloomberg Finance Fundamentals, where I learnt about the flow of money and the finance sector.",

I found it fascinating that banks use vast datasets to model diverse factors ranging from personal (income, debt), and organisational (risk appetite) to macro level (economic outlook) to arrive at a single number i.e. interest rate.\nIt was interesting to further read about yield curves and bond prices from Bank of England educational resources as it showed interpretation of data to reveal important signals e.g. use of yield curve as market's opinion on credibility of government's fiscal and monetary policies as well as economic forecast with upward slope signalling growth and inverted curves pointing to contraction.\nI want to study Economics as I am curious about use of information, data and economic theory to understand and predict how societies, markets and countries make decisions and adapt in complex conditions.\n\n2.How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nAs a finalist in Maths for Morality course run by \"leaf.courses\" I learnt to model resource allocation problem by calculating \"impact per dollar\" relative score for a range of issues such as extreme poverty and animal welfare. This was done by breaking the calculation into individual components i.e. Scale (Impact/% change in problem), Solvability (% change in problem/% change in resources) and Neglectedness (% change in resources/$), and then multiplying them back together. Using supplied data, the calculation led me to numbers of various magnitude - a problem I solved by use of logarithmic scaling where 10x difference would equal 1 unit, like \"Richter Scale\". The Q&A session on my work taught me importance of stating my assumptions, clarifying uncertainties in data as well supporting my work with qualitative analysis.\nI explored the topic of \"Socio-economic challenge of AI\" in my entry to Northeastern University's essay competition, where I was a top 20% finalist. As a result, I learnt about the modified Cobb-Douglas function, which uses capital, labour, human capital inputs along with their respective elasticities and tech-factor to predict economic output. On qualitative side I argued that AI will improve output due to uplift in \"Human Capital\" & \"Tech-Factor\" as it lowers the barriers by providing substitute for expertise and skills not available otherwise. On quantitative side, I used Solow's Growth Model to assess the tech factor as function of time and tech growth rate: A(t) = A​.e^λt. I created different graph plots by assuming different growth rates for a 5-year period to visualise significant impact of AI. Reading several papers from PwC, Accenture and EU parliament etc. also revealed challenges related to job losses, stressed labour relations & disruption in economy.\nFor University of Oxford's Big Think essay competition, I created a framework to assess the topic \"With rise of AI, do we need managers?\" and won the Economics & Management category. I focussed on Mintzberg's interpretation of managerial jobs as falling into interpersonal, informational, and decisional roles. I referenced an IMF research paper \"AI and the Future of Work\" to argue that by plotting \"exposure\" and \"complementarity\" (i.e. shielding from AI) on coordinate axes, jobs can be divided into 4 quadrants. I then evaluated risk of job losses based on the quadrant where different jobs may lie depending on their alignment with Mintzberg's roles. I further argued that new labour dynamics will emerge based on factors such as worker identity and societal acceptance of automation.\n\n3.What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nWhile studying market failure in Economics, I was struck by the contrasting views of Eugene Fama & Robert Shiller on markets. To explore Fama's ideas, I used Essentials of Investments by Bodie/Kane to build a CAPM project. Working through questions in the book helped me grasp the concept of returns, variance, covariance, and the use of log returns. I used R/RStudio to download dataset of monthly returns of five stocks alongside Fama-French factors to run excess-return regressions and estimate CAPM (alpha,beta) for each stock and then evaluated fit of charts against actual data. This exercise made it fascinating to read Shiller's critique of efficient market hypothesis as he challenges assumption of frictionless markets and highlights information asymmetry. It helped me appreciate the way foundational knowledge of economics and finance evolves over time and makes me look forward to discovering more as part of my university degree.",

    "statement_full_text": "1.Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nA Year 10 challenge with Lloyds Banking Group gave me my first insight into financial systems as I analysed customer data to set credit limits. Discovering how interest rates reflect lending risk and balance the needs of different groups sparked my fascination with economics.\nIt was not long before I was reading Bank of England resources on yield curves and impact of bond prices on economy as the negative effects of Liz Truss's budget became visible. The link between Economics, Finance, and daily life could not have been starker.\nI want to study Economics and Finance to channel my curiosity about how societies and economies function. By focusing on Econometrics, Microeconomics and Financial Markets, I hope to understand how individuals, societies, markets and countries make decisions and adapt in complex conditions.\n\n2.How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nI learnt quantitative methods to model abstract concepts such as scale of extreme poverty vs. impact of covid as a finalist in selective Maths for Morality course run by leaf.courses. I calculated relative scores by multiplying probability rating with expected benefits. However, this produced numbers of varying magnitude - a problem I solved by use of logarithmic scaling to build a \"Richter Scale\" like scoring where a unit difference represented 10x difference. I learnt the limitation of this model were that relatively small difference in probability data produced wildly different scores, and results were difficult to explain as logarithmic scale hid vast differences. These challenges made me curious about models and data used to predict scale of impact of one of the most disruptive technologies i.e. AI.\nI explored this in my entry to Northeastern University's essay competition on Economics, where I was a top 20% finalist. Follow up research into modified Cobb-Douglas function (Y = A(t).K^α.L^β.H^γ), showed me the use of capital, labour, human capital and tech factor, along with their respective elasticities, to predict the economic output. Modelling tech factor as function of time with different rates of AI growth revealed accelerated output growth, often touted by several sources. However, on more research I realised limits of this model due to multicollinearity and impact of tech factor on human capital which could well be negative due to job losses, stressed labour relations & disruption in economy. \nI further researched above pain-point in my entry to the Oxford University's \"Big Think\" essay competition where I won the Economics & Management category. I picked Mintzberg's interpretation of managerial job as mix of Interpersonal, Informational and Decisional roles and combined it with ideas of \"exposure\" and \"complementarity\" (i.e. shielding from AI) from IMF's research paper on \"AI and Future of Work\". I built my own framework where I assigned exposure and complementarity to the coordinate axes and placed Mintzberg's roles in different quadrants to support my argument. I further extended this framework arguing that labour dynamics depend on worker identity and societal acceptance of automation.\nSeparately, I explored how disruptive patents incentivize tech expansion while creating consumer welfare loss. Using Farrel and Shapiro's framework from \"The Economics of information technology\" to quantify consumer surplus, I found that while this drives R&D spending, it risks monopoly pricing, highlighting regulators' crucial role in balancing innovation incentives with consumer interests.\n\n3.What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nWhile studying market failure in Economics, I was struck by the contrasting views of Eugene Fama & Robert Shiller on markets. To explore Fama's ideas, I used Essentials of Investments by Bodie/Kane to build a CAPM project. Working through questions in the book helped me grasp the concept of returns, variance, covariance, and the use of log returns. I used R/RStudio to download dataset of monthly returns of five stocks alongside Fama-French factors to run excess-return regressions and estimate CAPM (alpha, beta) for each stock and then evaluated fit of charts against actual data.
