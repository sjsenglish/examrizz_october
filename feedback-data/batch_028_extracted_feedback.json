    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study medicine?\nA diagnosis can profoundly reshape a patient's life, disrupting routines, dictating treatment plans, and forcing difficult decisions. I want to study medicine because it allows me to support people through these pivotal moments while applying scientific knowledge to solve complex problems, a thought I reinforced through different opportunities. During my oncology work experience, I observed how short, focused communication could reduce a patients' anxiety and help them feel more in control. Volunteering by distributing meals and spending time with patients showed me that small, thoughtful actions (engaging someone in conversation or offering a warm drink) can enhance comfort and dignity, demonstrating that care extends beyond clinical decisions.\nShadowing a GP reinforced this in a faster-paced setting, where triage, clear communication, and time management ensured patients received appropriate care while feeling heard. Experiencing both hospital and primary care highlighted how medicine blends scientific reasoning with emotional intelligence, resilience, and adaptability—qualities I aspire to develop. These experiences confirmed that medicine offers a unique opportunity to combine intellectual challenge with meaningful social impact, helping people navigate uncertainty while contributing to their overall well-being.\nHow have your studies prepared you?\nMy A-levels in Biology and Chemistry provided a solid foundation in physiology and biochemistry, and allowed me to explore how scientific knowledge applies to real human experiences. Reading The Tell-Tale Brain by V.S. Ramachandran sparked my curiosity about how the brain influences behaviour, inspiring my EPQ on the neurological basis of behaviour. Through this project, I examined how brain function shapes cognition, emotion, and daily life, engaging with complex literature, designing structured research, and synthesising findings independently. The process strengthened my analytical thinking, honed my writing skills, and taught me to manage uncertainty—qualities essential in medical practice. It also revealed how diverse studies into brain function have shaped current medical approaches and treatments. \nStudying Philosophy encouraged me to consider ethical dilemmas in medicine. Applying the four pillars—autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice—helped me analyse balancing patient choice with clinical judgement and fair decisions about limited resources. Research into bionic prosthetics showed that over 65 million people worldwide need such devices, yet many cannot access one due to cost or systemic barriers (WHO/ISPO). This highlighted the tension between innovation and equitable healthcare, showing that scientific understanding gains meaning only when applied responsibly—an approach I aim to bring to my study of medicine.\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nTo prepare for a career in medicine, I have developed communication, resilience, and problem-solving skills through experiences that challenged me. As a shy child, growing up, I often would love to daydream and would use those daydreams to write stories, which taught me to see situations from multiple perspectives and understand others' motivations. While this built empathy, I knew that as a doctor I must take initiative and make decisive choices. Joining debate club was transformative: my first debate was nerve-wracking, yet it taught me to organise my thoughts, speak with clarity, and respond under pressure. Volunteering with Literacy Pirates further strengthened my patience and adaptability while supporting diverse learners. \nCompleting my Duke of Edinburgh Award reinforced these lessons practically. Long hikes and group challenges demanded persistence, problem-solving, and composure under stress—qualities vital in medicine. Archery honed my focus and attention to detail, showing how a steady, methodical approach shapes outcomes. These experiences, alongside continuing to write fiction, have strengthened cognitive, practical, and creative skills, nurturing adaptability and clarity of thought—qualities I aim to bring to my medical career.",

Exploring this interest further by attending a university laboratory outreach program. Opening my eyes to the effects of alphaheamolysin on DNA and its critically inhibiting mechanisms that harm the transport of oxygen. Gaining firsthand experience with PCR testing, educated me on how the use of heat the DNA unravels, DNA primers attach to their complementary target DNA sequence and tag polymerase begins a cycle of DNA replication continuing until the target DNA sequence is fully isolated. This challenged and applied my existing knowledge of DNA replication into an amplification technique. With firsthand experience using such astonishing technology confirms that even with such sophisticated biochemical systems, organisms are still vulnerable to disease through mutations and exposure. Reading into moral arguments on DNA in 'Can Science make sense of Life?' By Sheila Jasanoff provided an opportunity to challenge the assumption that biology alone defines human existence.\nScientific metaphors like the 'book of life' influence societal governance and the perception of identity. Law and ethics often lag behind rapid scientific advancements and biology is deeply tied to them so scientific understanding and governance is key to hold people accountable and respect human purpose and identity.\n2.\nEntering the CCIR Re:think essay competition on Genetic engineering allowed me to exercise preexisting knowledge on gene editing alongside researching into CRISPR technology, and its socially divided points of view involving He Jiankui. Clearly highlighting the importance of authority and regulatory efforts to prevent scientific ambition from overshadowing responsibility and consent. Taking advantage of my EPQ I explored AMR, the unpredictable pathways and mechanisms scientists must consider whilst developing new drugs. The development of drugs became of particular interest after attending a cancer-focused workshop. Limiting side effects whilst balancing efficacy and efficiency is a hard line, as to keep patient experience and moral at its highest. Highlighting pharmacodynamics to drugs in relation to Candida Auris was key, due to its nature as a pathogen, being mono-resistant and in some serious cases pan-resistant resulting in a high mortality rate. Existence of super-bugs that are highly likely to become resistant fascinated me due to their inherent genetic features, like high propensity for mutations to occur in resistance genes. An online course on Preclinical Safety by Davidson College, exposed me to the necessity of regulatory policies to reduce genotoxicity in patients. Testing for genotoxicity in vitro using the Ames test is used to identify compounds that are potentially carcinogenic within a cell culture. However, if the compound is mutagenic more bacterial colonies will survive and then be observed at the end of the assay. Screening a compound against a panel of targets is imperative to discover which has a higher collective risk in order to reduce undermining a patient's health.\n3.",

There isn't a requirement to master a particular skillset in the way you would be expected to with other subjects. The fundamentals of designing the built environment, revolves around artistic abilities, historical knowledge, mathematical expertise and so on. Once chapels with towers at imposingly tall heights, the physical embodiment of man stretching his hand to the heavens, replaced by modern day skyscrapers. Just like the ever-changing landscape we are surrounded by; our approach to architectural development follows this trend, which is increasingly clear from the shift of past traditional methodology to digital applications. By completing an online Architecture course in Year 12, I was able to learn the history of planning, along with being introduced to several key components of architecture. Namely, uncovering the roots of the word 'landscape' and the varying definitions, one of which suggested by Malcolm Andrew who states 'German Landschaft […] was not originally a view of nature but rather a geographic area defined by political boundaries.' After watching the 'Settlers of the West Bank' documentary, focusing on colonial settlers of occupied Palestinian territory, I saw with clarity that the 'landscape' of what was once Palestine, had become a new country, unperturbed by the mass settler colonial project of the native population accompanying its genesis. Last year, I became a co-collaborator to design a temporary installation for the William Morris Gallery, at the forefront, paying tribute to his legacy as a socialist and environmentally conscious artist in the design of the pavilion, using repurposed timber from previous builds. Throughout the project's planning, we visited multiple architectural and engineering firms, presenting our work at times, which provided me with the opportunity to practise meaningful communication that will be vital in future group projects and design reviews. However, as part of focusing on environmental impacts, this includes every part of a build, from planning to construction, to function. As we approach the date designated by world leaders for achieving net zero, 2050, by which it is already estimated the average global temperature will have increased by 2°C presenting a barrage of life-altering climate events, leading to the remaining architecture being unsuited to the world it finds itself in. What comes to mind especially, is my mother's home country Pakistan, where in 2022, flash floods caused submerging of 1/3 of the country at one point, claiming a minimum of 1739 lives. Partly due to the lack of infrastructure and clear safety regulations, as there has only recently been a revision of the NBCP, this is exacerbated by the majority living in rural, poorly constructed buildings still in existence, with little hope to be updated, that cannot withstand environmental disasters of this capacity.",
