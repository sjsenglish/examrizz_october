    "statement_full_text": "My work experience with both a chartered quantity surveyor and law firm Adam Benedict, was incredibly insightful as it allowed me to witness the process that goes into construction law from both professions, and the communication between the two that arises from this. The trainee solicitor I was shadowing taught me that a part of law is being able to quickly analyse and conclude cases - a majority of it is simply reading information from clients. One of the tasks I was set was to read through a file and make note of any important dates and summarise the argument from the Claimant. In order to improve my analysis and active reading skills, I entered a Caius Explore competition for English and attempted the reading technique, practical criticism. This experience was valuable to me as it pushed me to be patient and learn to appreciate the uncertainties of it, but it also allowed me to develop arguments based on the text and my thoughts alone; without the influence of context. This task forced me to read with purpose and constantly question the text whilst reading, further strengthening my analysis skills. Furthermore, at my school I act as a Senior Reading Ambassador which aims to help and improve the comprehension skills of younger students that perhaps struggle with reading, or are unable to practice this at home. Originally, I applied in order to improve my confidence and public speaking; whilst this position did help me accomplish this, it also improved my communicative skills as I work closely with a group of students and teachers, and suggested implementing a reward system in order to encourage pupils.",

    "statement_full_text": "I have always been fascinated by Economics and I realised my interest when doing some basic reading on the subject in the beginning of Year 9. I was sceptical of capitalism and sought a more balanced perspective on the matter by reading the Liberal Manifesto. In doing so I became more convinced that market economies and free trade are critical in reducing poverty and sparking growth globally. In his manifesto, it is said that Socialism is ultimately incompatible with democracy, which is an argument that is echoed by Friedman in Capitalism and Freedom. However, I feel like there is a false dichotomy implied when it comes to thinking about these systems. In reality, governments can play a complementary role to the markets by intervening and providing merit goods, such as healthcare. Friedman rejects this notion, and Norberg overlooks the limitations of this approach, as economics is ultimately about trade-offs.\n\nSecond, I took a \"metrics\" Master Class on regression from Imperial College London, where I looked at the relationship between Gross Capital Formation and gross GDP, which helped me understand the relationship between savings, investment, and growth by using real world data. Then, I read \"Animal Spirits\" which emphasises how psychology and human error play a bigger role in markets than neoclassical economics might suggest, especially after the Great Financial Crisis. In contrast, the neoliberals don't believe that psychology is a factor in economics. I concluded that such forces justify greater government intervention. For my EPQ, I investigated the relationship between housing estates and violent crime within London Boroughs. I conducted literature reviews in order to find variables that could impact crime, including population density, employment, inequality, amongst other factors. Additionally, I gained an insight into how to use statistical software, R, and excel for multivariate data analysis.\n\nAdditionally, I explored the connection between economics and politics by taking a Yale lecture series on liberalism, showing the evolution of political philosophy from Locke to Rawls, which has given me a broader understanding of the relationship between politics and economics in liberal societies. Witnessing this evolution has given me greater understanding of the role of rights, justice, and governance in economic policy. I read Fukuyama's Liberalism and its Discontents, which argues that political populism both left and right stems from the loss of trust in democratic institutions. This is especially interesting as populism challenges the efficiency of markets and restricts free trade, which are both pivotal concepts in economics.\n\nThird, outside of academia, I was the captain of my football team for 3 years, leading training sessions and organising fixtures. This helped improve my leadership and organisational skills. I also play the Violin and am working towards my grade 8 exam, which has been challenging but rewarding, teaching me discipline and patience through consistent practice. I completed my Duke of Edinburgh Bronze, Silver, and Gold awards which required teamwork, resilience, and perseverance through difficult expeditions. Moreover, I completed a 6 month long school mentor program, mentoring younger students. These experiences have allowed me to develop important life skills such as responsibility, empathy, and the ability to work well with others.",

        "weak_passage": "Third, outside of academia, I was the captain of my football team for 3 years, leading training sessions and organising fixtures. This helped improve my leadership and organisational skills. I also play the Violin and am working towards my grade 8 exam, which has been challenging but rewarding, teaching me discipline and patience through consistent practice. I completed my Duke of Edinburgh Bronze, Silver, and Gold awards which required teamwork, resilience, and perseverance through difficult expeditions. Moreover, I completed a 6 month long school mentor program, mentoring younger students. These experiences have allowed me to develop important life skills such as responsibility, empathy, and the ability to work well with others.",
