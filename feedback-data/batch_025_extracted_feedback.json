    "statement_full_text": "Engineering shapes every part of our lives, from the small details on our phones to the aircraft that transport people across the world. Each detail is crafted to enhance many different products. My interest in design and creativity began through playing video games, where I expressed myself by designing personal projects. This initial interest led me to pursue analytics behind social media trends. For my HPQ, I explored why videos go viral and the data related. This experience taught me to look beyond numbers and identify underlying patterns within them. The key turning point was visiting KROHNE, a local engineering company. I was fascinated by how complex products work in unison through precise measurement. My passion for aerospace engineering began with Formula 1, where aerodynamics and precision drive performance. I was captivated by the speed and intensity of the sport and listening to Susie Wolff and Claire Williams on Netflix's 'Drive to Survive,' I realised that, despite being male-dominated, motorsport offered different careers that I could aspire to pursue. I enrolled in an aerospace course where we explored the flight mechanics of foam gliders and designed a more optimised solution that would counter current weaknesses. This involved iterative testing and constant criticism of aerodynamic performance. Webinars hosted by InvestIn highlighted the realities of a career in engineering. I was drawn to the dynamic, unpredictability, and the demand for both adaptability and resilience. Next, I gained hands-on experience at Judd Power, utilising SolidWorks, where I designed 3D models, including an engine cover that was integrated into their design. This experience cemented my passion for design and my love for the fast-paced field of motorsport and aeronautics.\nStudying Product Design enhanced my interest in engineering and design, as it allowed me to develop skills, exploring CAD and CFD inspired me to do further research into their applications in engineering. I began watching Chain Bear on YouTube, discussing aerodynamics and taught me concepts, like downforce and vortex reduction. Managing the demands of my NEA coursework with three other subjects was a challenge, forcing me to develop my organisation and time management skills, ensuring I stayed on schedule and met personal deadlines. Pursuing Further Maths outside of school has been a challenge that has been pushed by my personal motivation. It has taught me the importance of self-directed study and of fully mastering a topic before moving on. In Physics and Maths Society at school, I presented complex topics such as the Dual-Axis Steering (DAS) system from the 2020 Mercedes F1 car, improving my confidence and communication of technical ideas. Beyond education, I took part in an online course run by TEDI. It was based on sustainable fashion, a topic that I had never considered for designing a product for, but found I really enjoy. This course challenged me to apply my design and reasoning skills in a new aspect of engineering and really pushed me out of my comfort zone.\nOutside of education, I am a member of my town's football team, where I have developed in skill, communication, and trust. Volunteering with a female karting team allowed me to gain practical experience with kart mechanics, understanding of the different engine types used across different race series, and through analysing data with a racer and their mentor, I learned the importance of teamwork and clear communication needed in high-pressure environments. This was reinforced when I spent a day down in the Formula E paddock with Girls on Track, where we were shown different roles in motorsport and how we could get involved with different motorsports at a younger age. I completed an online course with JLR, the highlight being designing a custom car, and justifying my design choices. I attended a course in London, hosted by InvestIn, where we explored the many different engineering fields and different engineers spoke about careers, mentioning the benefits and flaws. I volunteered at a local primary school to explore these subjects in further education. I ran interactive sessions, showing pupils how to create non-Newtonian fluids. I took part in a work experience programme, run by STEMETTES, where I helped deliver an event to primary school pupils and supported the design of online activities for the future. These experiences fuelled my desire to inspire and educate the next generation of STEM pupils.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nI read an article exploring how student mental health is under increasing strain now more than ever due to social disruptions including the pandemic, economic pressures and even natural disasters. In the EU, 40% of students in higher education report troubles with their mental health or wellbeing. This growing issue gives the opportunity for psychological research to excel and find appropriate approaches to support these students. In another survey, psychological researchers identified 'federated learning' using AI as a suitable method as it can observe mental health data without breaching confidentiality. This matter made me appreciate the important role of psychological research in education and how it can supply ethical approaches to a grave issue like mental health. Listening to podcasts by the British Psychological Society expanded my understanding on the variety of psychological research and how this can be applied to almost anything from superstition to grief. The magnitude of the role that psychology plays in daily life intrigues me, especially how it can be utilised in education to improve the lives of students. For example, according to the EEF, psychological findings show that using metacognitive and self-regulation strategies provide an extra eight months of progress compared to the usual over a year.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nMy A-Level Spanish course has widened my outlook on how linguistic and cultural influences shape communication and behaviour, linking closely to social psychology. Learning and using this second language have also made me more curious about cognitive psychology and how the brain processes and stores language. My A-level history course has sharpened my ability to critically evaluate sources and assess bias, essential skills in psychology when interpreting case studies or research findings. My A-Level maths course has enabled me to develop problem solving techniques which will enhance my ability to tackle psychological questions logically as well as to assess the validity of different hypotheses. In addition to this, A-Level maths will ensure that I have the skills to thrive with statistics and data interpretation, important components of a psychology course.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nAn 'introduction to psychology' MOOC from Yale had me particularly interested in clinical, developmental and educational psychology. Reading 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat' by Oliver Sacks, a clinical psychologist, made me understand how personal accounts can highlight complex neurological and developmental disorders. I then completed a MOOC called 'Understanding child development: from synapse to society' by Utrecht University which taught me how different themes such as social, cognitive and emotional psychology come together to produce a clearer understanding of development. After completing the MOOC 'Childhood adversity: the impact of childhood maltreatment on mental health' by UCL, I began to understand the correlation between traumatic events early in life with development and that this increases the chances of mental health issues in later life. The course gave me an insightful view from a clinician, neuroscientist and an educator which taught me that this and many other current psychological issues are applicable to a variety of fields. I followed up my interest from these courses with my own practical work experience where I applied psychological theory in educational contexts in both a nursery for a year and then with a SENCO in a primary school where I learnt how teaching methods adapt to children with a variety of disorders. I worked closely with a child who had experienced trauma, and I was able to see how this affected him as a year 5 student with a mental age of a year 2 who resented any loss of routine and could not cope without assistance. I also had a meeting with an educational psychologist which gave me an opportunity to learn about their role and develop my interest in this area.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nGrowing up, I recall disassembling toys and household appliances to investigate how moving parts and electrical circuits worked daily. I found myself asking, 'How do things move on their own?\" year by year, these thoughts continued to linger; this has led me to understand how I could use this conviction to develop systems which people use every day.\nThroughout my academic journey, I have built my knowledge around various fields of engineering and how important this is in modern life. As expected, engineering is at the heart of how societies operate, from small elements of mechanical systems which power transportation networks to the electrical systems which keep the world connected. Therefore, my goal is simple: I want to develop my knowledge and understanding of how systems collaborate to create the technology we use on a day- to-day basis. This will help me address problems on a global scale.\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you prepare for this course or subject?\nMy current studies in Mathematics and Physics have allowed me to build upon my ability to use abstract notions in tangible, practical contexts. For example, within the mechanics module of the course, I was exposed to kinematics; here, I used calculations to determine forces and acceleration with precision for a block sliding down an inclined surface. A major obstacle I came across was calculating the acceleration by balancing the forces of gravity and friction. I used Newton's principles and algebra to work this out. Today, I am aware of the importance of math modelling when it comes to the world of engineering.\nTo develop my knowledge further, I took the initiative and availed myself of 'To Engineer is Human'. Here, I was exposed to how engineering involves a multitude of theoretical modules, which are evaluated against reality. From my understanding, design failures can lead to advancements within the field, and as an aspiring Engineer, I am constantly striving to enhance different models which are of my calibre. This is important in maintaining an equilibrium between gravity and friction, step by step, to discover acceleration.\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nMy professional experiences at the Orsted virtual program have given me insight into how theory works in the real world. Here, I took part in a multitude of activities where innovation came together to provide effective and long-lasting solutions. From my understanding, the concept of engineering is all about having a long-lasting effect, as I have gone through a multitude of video courses and case studies; this has walked me through the process of managing large-scale renewable projects. This has given me the opportunity to adopt an 'engineering mindset', as I became more disciplined and better at solving problems.\nAdditionally, I exposed myself to the Siemens virtual work experience, where I developed my knowledge on how sustainability and design choices work together simultaneously in big projects. I observed the various engineers weigh the pros and cons of several designs and express their different concepts of innovation to each other. This was a moment of realisation for me: communication is at the forefront of engineering, a core skill I have built during my experiences.\nThis led me to take part in an engineering project, where I was responsible for solving a challenge. One of the parts I struggled with the most included coming up with a construction which could hold up weight without using too much material. Therefore, to solve the problem, I used the foundation I had already built in Engineering over my academic journey and applied it directly to this project. My approach was simple: I assessed the forces which were operating on the system. I applied physics and algebra to figure out where the stress would lead to the system breaking. From this, I investigated several design alternatives which tested how changes in shape changed both the stability and efficiency. Today, I understand how failures are chances to change, as each unsuccessful model taught me how to make the next system better.",

In both, economic regeneration and development has been at the expense of the inner city, sustaining social division and urban deprivation. Witnessing these conditions led me to question how policy neglect shapes the individual experience of the built environment. Geography and Economics give me the opportunity to find the answer and explore how I can confront urban inequality to build more inclusive urban futures.\nA UNIQ Summer School lecture introduced me to Ghanaian farming tenancy contracts. I was particularly interested in the 'abunu' system (where landlord and farmer share land and produce equally). Realising the potential for power asymmetry between landlord and farmer, I wanted to understand their relationship further. To this end, I read an article on tenurial relations in rural Ghana. Its argument that abunu inhibits land control and equality for farmers was valid. However, by ignoring the economic rationale for choosing the contracts, it failed to address why these arrangements persist. I resolved this by modelling hypothetical cost and revenue functions to compare outcomes in abunu and a fixed rent system. Abunu, though less profitable, mitigated the financial risk of failed harvests and labour shortages present in fixed rent agreements. This risk-averse response showed me how uncertainty influences choice, a theme I discussed in my commended entry to the Gerald O'Connell Essay Prize.\nCaldeira's 'City of Walls' exposed me to how urban geography can reveal power imbalances embedded into cities. The 'condomínios fechados', with their high walls and gated upper-class communities, were particularly striking when set against the expansion of informal 'favela' settlements. The contrast of security and affluence versus poor state control and infrastructure presented a spatially and socially fragmented city. This challenged me to see space not as neutral, but a device for socio-economic and political control. A Guardian article on Brazilian social housing highlighted the ineffective policy response of the government. I mostly agreed with the critique that housing was distant from economic activity and construction firms prioritised profitable margins over quality. Yet, the article ignored the benefits of state-backed mortgage and credit provision to São Paulo's poorest families, enabling property ownership. This tension showed me how policy can promote economic inclusion and entrench inequality. I am excited to grapple with tensions in policy more broadly in future study.\nReading Ben Wilson's 'Urban Jungle' made me question nature's place in the contemporary city. I explored his central argument, that rewilding cities reflects our innate affinity to nature, further through a research project into biophilic design in Singapore. My research, which I entered to the St John's College Poster Competition, involved analysing data from health journal articles to understand the effects of natural spaces like Gardens by the Bay on mental health. In finding reductions in depression and anxiety risk, the benefits of greening were clear. Yet, there were also limitations. Extensive capital investment and coordination are needed to promote urban greening, making me question its feasibility in all urban contexts. These limitations became clearer in considering Lagos. I found the opportunity cost of large-scale greening too high for a city grappling with poverty and corruption. Thus, legal and financial systems must become more robust before greening can reap the benefits Wilson details.\nAt HSBC, I undertook work experience in Global Trade, analysing data on the environmental impact of supply chains. This deepened my understanding of sustainable business activity and improved my data literacy skills. Analysing ESG reports, I was able to assess and recommend opportunities for HSBC to finance sustainable projects. This experience revealed the interdependence of economics and the environment, a relationship at the core of Geography and Economics.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nCommuting between home and school takes me from cracked sidewalks and corner shops to tree-lined streets and luxury houses. This exposure to inequality introduced economics and management as tools to understand the issues that individuals, firms, and governments hesitate to confront. My experiences in studying them reinforces my commitment to these subjects.\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\"Utopia for Realists\" by Rutger Bregman confronts this inequality by exploring how a focus on capital has restricted labour markets. He argues that government policy should rebalance this dynamic. However, I question his thesis as the costs of not utilising capital, from lower performance to lower wages can further limit labour, exacerbating inequality. Capital-driven firms have historically driven innovation, and I believe government intervention might limit this progress. Although this revealed inequality as a link between firm and government behaviour, I was unconvinced that I discovered the root forces that sustain inequality in its various forms around the world.\n\"The Winner-Take-All Society\" argues that marginal advantages lead to disproportionate rewards, concentrating wealth and income among a few people. I agree as this deepened my belief that society has a flawed association of wealth and status with capability. My independent research investigation on if the Matthew Effect occurs in firms' job shortlisting assessed how major success can depend on minor conditions beyond your control. What fascinated me was how my subjects rewarded the privileged over equally capable candidates from disadvantaged backgrounds, echoing Rivera and Tilcsik's report on socioeconomic markers. I believe this produces a suboptimal labour market as talent is systematically overlooked and underutilised, reflecting the environments many people work in. Naturally, my investigation questioned the responsibility firms bear in addressing inequality.\nIn the Minds Underground essay competition, I mentioned a Universal Basic Income could be funded by corporate taxes on economic assets like data. I now contend this, as it inhibits digital investment and disincentivises market entry as data's role in innovation and competition expands. This introduced economics as a study that unpacks the nuanced interactions among economic agents, and prepares me to explore their connection more through ways like strategic deployment.\nA class on the impacts of US' tariffs introduced me to international competition. In an essay, I concluded that protectionism reduces the appeal of international trade, prompting nations to rely on inefficient domestic production. Founding my co-podcast (\"Insight to Econ\" on Spotify) allowed me to study this further by discussing how managerial economics can help recognise how firms adapt to tariffs. It was insightful to learn that in these conditions, managers often prioritise survival over profit, demonstrated by Apple diversifying their supply chain beyond China to reduce recent tariff impacts. Orally expressing these ideas prepared me to excel to the Finals Day in the Oxford Schools Debating competition. I enjoyed arguing that companies should get management to periodically work entry level jobs, challenging the hierarchical structure in many firms. However, I learned that this depends on if their current organisational structure leans towards a mechanistic or organic model.\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nSpeaking with NatWest's operations team revealed how the UK challenges have scarred the bank. Showing how they analyse problems helped me to see how AI models enhance solutions. My EPQ argued that AI could replace human work, but I was challenged after learning from Coutts who use LLMs in wealth management services. Both work experiences taught me that the cost of AI technology often exceeds labour, contrary to my original belief. Economics and management are not just about what can happen, but what actually does - in the practical space where theory meets the reality I am eager to study further.",
