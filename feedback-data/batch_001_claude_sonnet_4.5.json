    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nBeing Malaysian-born, I have spent the two halves of my life living around two major cities- Kuala Lumpur and London. Through this exposure, I observed the many comparisons between a rapidly emerging economy and one that is more mature. Though at a young age this was simply the physical characteristics I observed, such as stark differences in how much lunch would cost me, to the difference between car vs public transport usage. It was when I began to develop my economic understandings, through Edward Glaeser's Triumph of the City, which helped me transition what I had known as simply physical spaces to the intrinsic economic systems which designed these cities. Glaeser outlines the importance of urban density, infrastructure and effective policy making to create cities that drive economic growth. This reinforced my fascination in urban and developmental economics, intriguing me in what lies at the heart of cities, being the economic frameworks that shape the infrastructure and characteristics of each place. In a world where inequality is rife, we look to the economic institutions and frameworks to deduce reasonings for such a spread in global prosperity. Despite the aforementioned differences, the issues consistent with all nations around the globe are the social and environmental repercussions that come with economic affairs. As Head Boy and chair of the sustainability committee I have long been an advocate for sustainability, therefore I was naturally drawn to these concepts within the subject. Whether it be the mass deforestation from an urban growth sprawl or a governments corruption worsening inequality, it has become clear to me the importance of balancing these economic trade-offs with social and environmental sustainability, using effective policy to ensure a well-maintained economy.\n\nMy interest in economics wasn't inherent in me but rather stemmed by my wider passions for a range of subjects and disciplines. In an aim to develop skills of interdisciplinary linking, I\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped to prepare for this course or subject?\nBuilding upon the knowledge that I gained through my a-levels, I completed an EPQ, titled \"To what extent does Formula 1 drive sustainable economic growth\". This independent research project led me to investigate the macroeconomic impacts that the sport has on its host nations, balancing empirical and quantitative analysis with critical reasoning of qualitative ideas. This forced me to apply the theoretical concepts of economics to real-world situations, showing me the importance of considering how economic activity is assessed, not just through the economic gains but also considering the social and environmental externalities that are present.\n\nWhile studying the trade and commerce of the British Empire in History, I was particularly horrified to learn about the many atrocities that colonialism brought about for the nations involved – further fascinating me in developmental economics. Through exploring contrasting perspectives by economist's Jeffrey Sachs and Acemoglu & Robinson, I saw different interpretations on the development of economies. Sachs stresses the importance of geographic factors such as climate, location and natural resources as the inhibition development. I however, align with the views of Acemoglu and Robinson, shown in their book Why Nations Fail. Upon learning the economic detriments that Britain had left on her colonies, through means of exploitation and imposed dependency reducing economic diversification, I was able to see the patterns of under-developed countries all over the world having one thing in common- colonialism. This has shown me the imperative strength that institutions play on the trajectory of nations and their economies, one again solidifying a need for effective economic frameworks in order for nations to prosper. (Now need to link to course)\n\nI decided to further explore in my school-published academic piece, the interdisciplinary nature of economics, particularly assessing the importance of mathematics and history to shape economic understanding. Through this, I gained an adequate grasp into the ability to link econometric models with historical data to analyse complex models with a clear contextual understanding. Analysing case studies from the 2008 financial crash to US post-war economic boom, showed me how the assumptions made while creating numerical models can amplify risks in their accuracy therefore it is essential to use historical context and continued refinement of models in order to produce policies that are reflective and precise. I was made particularly aware of the importance of being able to solve economic problems mathematically therefore ensured that my skills in this were strengthened, ranking in the top 15% of entrants in UKMT Senior maths challenge with a silver award.\n\nWhat have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nAfter solidifying my academic pursuits, I sought to immerse myself into professional industries with a week of hybrid work experience with Lloyds Banking Group. This opportunity allowed me to gain a perspective on how economic theories are utilised in complex real-world scenarios where factors such as technological advancements and resource management and risk assessment must be considered. It was particularly useful to hear how such a large company is adapting to the ever-changing structure of the economy, with plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence into the world of banking. I was exposed to the importance of behavioural economics in a consumer-based structure, using it as a tool to encourage consumer activities. I decided to explore this further in the presentation that we were tasked to create and perform at the end of the programme, particularly looking at how to increase the economic performance of Lloyd's in a sustainable manner. This forced me to develop knowledge into the interconnected nature of economics, manipulating consumer behaviour to boost economic growth sustainably, ensuring that I am able to critically link ideas within the subject.\n\nTo augment my knowledge, I availed myself into the LSE lecture series with a lecture on 'Climate Capitalism', looking at whether we can use market-based solutions to solve the ongoing climate crisis. It was valuable to hear from distinguished academics on a topic I am fond of, which clarified to me the ability to utilise economic activity, in this case, particularly behavioural and market-based economics to manipulate global causes. Professor Daniela Gabor stated that the fate of our climate lies in the economic future of China, this was an idea I was familiar with, having remembered Edward Glaeser detailing this in his aforementioned book. Glaeser suggests that if China continues to grow at its +5% GDP per annum, we must hope they follow a more modest European carbon emissions as if it is to mirror USA's then the world's emissions would rise by over 60%. This truly sparks my passion to further developing my economic understandings, in the hope that one day I may harness this to create effective policy that helps maintain our global state.\n\nBeyond academia, volunteer work is a great ambition of mine, having created a charity initiative, \"Clothing with a Conscience\", organising annual events raising money for many causes…. I pride myself in the refugee tutoring that I am apart of, teaching a range of subjects to displaced children, allowing me to test my communication, by teaching even with language barriers while helping ambitious students… Being a track and field athlete has provided me with the freedom beyond academia…\n(Unsure if I will include this paragraph at all therefore not developed it yet)\n\nWhilst studying the trade and commerce of the British empire in History, I was particularly fascinated by Chamberlain's contentious tariff reform proposals of the early 1900s. The policies aimed to strengthen imperial economic unity and protect domestic industries, mirror the modern debates over protectionism, from Brexit's EU trade disruptions to recent US tariff increases. I deepened my understanding using Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz's International Economics: Theory and Policy, which reinforced that the aims of these trade policies have been consistent over time and their long-standing usage suggesting a perceived success in achieving such aims. I was particularly intrigued by the economic models used to measure the cost and benefits of a Tariff for the importing country, considering the consumer, producer and government gain or loss through these policies to calculate a net welfare effect, a development on the more simplistic consumer/producer surplus models I had studied. From this I gained a more nuanced understanding in economic trade policy and the cyclical nature of economic history with the recurrence of certain trade patterns.",

    "statement_full_text": "My parents' remittances to relatives in Sri Lanka made me question why families, rather than institutions, often provide the safety net when economic systems fall short. Through the Lucy Cavendish AAP, I came to realise that these transfers are more than financial transactions: they reflect the reality that economic systems do not serve everyone equally. Analysing Sri Lanka's dependence on remittances, I found it linked to the shortcomings of its industrialisation strategy, which failed to deliver the infrastructure and job creation needed to retain workers at home. This underdevelopment left the economy reliant on migrant labour abroad. To combat this, I initially researched orthodox approaches, applying a Ricardian model of comparative advantage to suggest that Sri Lanka could specialise in sectors and use RCEP free trade to expand export-led growth. I soon recognised that the model's assumptions ignore institutional weaknesses and asymmetries in bargaining power, leaving the tertiary sector stifled and its workers exploited as cheap labour. Ha Joon Chang's 'Kicking Away the Ladder' reinforced the view that nations such as 19th century Germany, which now advocate free trade, historically relied on protectionism to nurture their own industries. This revealed how the theory of comparative advantage (you don't need to explain comparative advantage to tutors) diverges from the historical reality of how industrialised economies actually developed. I concluded that strategic tariffs could safeguard key sectors and that economic orthodoxies must be re-examined from first principles.\n\nWanting to explore systemic fragility more broadly, I turned to the LSESU essay competition, where I examined why a crisis in AI is inevitable. Drawing on Randall Wray's interpretation of Minsky, I argued that prolonged stability encourages riskier financial behaviour, increasing the probability of collapse. Considering the rapid diffusion of AI, I analysed how general purpose technologies drive cyclical volatility, reshape labour markets and heighten systemic risks. Driven to investigate how the burden of a crisis could be redistributed I read a GavTax article exploring whether a targeted levy on AI-driven profits could help redistribute gains from concentrated sectors. I ultimately sided with a 2% levy on the ten largest firms, which I estimated would generate ~£1.2bn annually according to 2024 profit data, for subsidising wages and retraining programs. However, the levy could be undermined by avoidance and offshoring, highlighting that policy design must account for human incentives: even well intentioned measures can fail without enforcement. This experience showed me that, while economic theory can guide the design of interventions, it cannot fully determine outcomes, though carefully implemented policies can still shape how the fallout of crises is distributed, balancing technical effectiveness with ethical considerations.\n\nApplying this idea to the UK education policy, I found that modelling per pupil spending against GCSE attainment across 120 schools using OLS regression. Initially, my regression suggested higher spending improved outcomes by 15%, but including class size as an additional control reduced the effect to 5%- implying that a portion of the apparent benefit of spending was actually driven by smaller classes allowing for more personalised support. This reinforced the importance of accounting for omitted variables: failing to do so could lead policymakers to overestimate the impact of increased funding. The project reinforced that different model specifications can produce different policy recommendations, and a careful consideration of variables is essential when advising on fiscal and educational interventions. (If you can't cut anymore I'd cut this paragraph- sorry)\n\nAs founder of my school's Economics society, I debated nationalisation and privatisation, initially defending the private sector's superior efficiency. Yet, during the JP Morgan APP Programme, when I presented a cost-benefit analysis of Sainsbury's acquisition, I saw how the very practices that drive private firms, can also impose wider social costs, from job losses to environmental strain. In contrast, the podcast 'Derailed, HS2' revealed how public projects face a different set of pressures, yet also the political necessity of pursuing long term regional equity. These experiences made me realise that while privatisation promises innovation and efficiency, it can neglect equity and sustainability; public ownership, though politically contentious, often shoulders responsibilities that markets will not.\n\nEarning UKMT Gold and exploring the Game Theory 101 series sharpened my ability to follow complex reasoning and apply maths in new contexts. Mentoring in GCSE Economics and Maths deepened my appreciation from derivation to application, while captaining my county badminton team strengthened my communication and time management.- REFERENCE)\n\nI am excited to build on these experiences by studying economics at university.",

Eager to learn more about housing, I attended the Murray Edwards AHSS Land Economy taster lecture on rent control. The brief mention of how the war in Ukraine affected housing markets in neighbouring countries particularly interested me, as I had hosted a Ukrainian family during that time. To explore this further, I read Gluszak's 'War in Ukraine, the refugee crisis, and the Polish Housing Market', through which I discovered that Poland faced a short-term housing demand shock from an influx of Ukrainian refugees, driving up rents. I was intrigued that rents increased but house prices did not, and I understood this to be because of tenure choice theory, as many refugees preferred to rent than buy, knowing their stay in Poland would be temporary. Curious about how rent could be reduced in such situations, I reflected back on the lecture's example of first-generation rent control used in Berlin. This showed me that while rent control can reduce rents in buildings covered by the policy, it ultimately worsens housing affordability by reducing supply of rental units and increasing rents in uncontrolled parts of the market through the substitution effect. Therefore, I think rent control can be effective in cases of the Ukraine war in Poland for the short-term but it is not sustainable in the long-term. Policies that increase housing supply, and provide targeted support for those struggling to afford, in my view, are better suited to address the root cause of housing unaffordability, which I look forward to exploring further at university.",

    "statement_full_text": "Section 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nA difficult problem can be solved by breaking it down into its components, showing perseverance, and applying creative thought. In a BMO proof on geometry, I attempted to use a coordinate geometry method, but was surprised that considering similar triangles revealed a far more elegant way forward, demonstrating that logical thinking is developed by exposing yourself to as many ideas as possible, ultimately using a distinct combination to solve a problem. This quality is what draws me to mathematics and its physical applications.\n\nSection 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nOne of my early experiences in problem solving was completing the COMPOS programme, where I enjoyed being exposed to alternative methods on difficult problems in the tutorials. My drive to challenge myself has led to success in competitions, achieving several Gold awards and 3 Kangaroo qualifications in the UKMT challenges. I also earned a Merit in the OUCC, a Gold in the Senior Physics Challenge, and a Silver in the British Physics Olympiad (placing in the UK top 300) - despite participating a year early. To stretch my abilities in proof, I enjoy tackling BMO questions, particularly abstract logic problems for their unfamiliarity, challenging me to develop new approaches.\n\nMy exploration of Euclidean geometry through the UKMT book has developed my appreciation for methods in geometric proof, such as similarity, which I particularly enjoyed for its flexibility in application to a range of proofs. On exploring the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, I developed a proof of a related 3D triangle inequality utilising the roots of polynomials and Vieta's formulae. This was fascinating, exemplifying the interconnectedness of mathematical concepts, which is often key to solving difficult problems in mathematics or physics.\n\nFurthermore, studying linear algebra has fascinated me due its geometric interpretations and varied applications to problem solving, such as the use of linear transformations in finding roots of unity. This led me to a MOOC covering methods such as LU decomposition (which I enjoyed for its intuitive use in finding solutions to non-square systems) as well as applications such as Markov chains. This was fascinating due to how simple probability rules can be a powerful tool in prediction when applied iteratively. I was also a finalist on the Leaf maths course, covering topics such as Bayes theorem, which I used to make numerical decisions and optimise outcomes based on probability.\n\nSection 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nIn the F1 in Schools competition, I developed a fascination for fluid mechanics, using CFD simulation and test data to optimise designs. As my team's engineer, I developed a system using calculus to analyse test data, allowing aerodynamic efficiency to be determined regardless of car mass. This work, alongside collaboration with the rest of my team, led to us building the fastest car in the West Midlands, qualifying for the National Finals. My interest led me to complete an engineering placement at the Mercedes F1 team, focusing on CFD software.\n\nRecently, I designed a 2D CFD solver in Python, capable of simulating liquid flow given initial conditions. The solver approximated solutions to Navier-Stokes equations using Poisson's equation to enforce incompressibility and iteratively correct velocity fields. This exposed me to new mathematical methods such as the finite difference method to estimate solutions to PDEs. I built on my interest in mathematical simulation through a physics placement at the University of Leicester, where I explored how software such as GMAT utilises the Newton-Raphson method, iteratively solving Kepler's equations to simulate elliptical orbits or Hohmann transfer manoeuvres.\n\nThese experiences have developed my appreciation for the links between mathematical concepts and physical phenomena, strengthened my ability to persist through a complex problem and solidified my drive to further explore mathematics and its physical applications at university.",

This curiosity led me to explore electrical circuits and understand how individual components function within real world systems, especially at the component level.\n\nReading \"Bebop to the Boolean Boogie\" by Clive Maxfield gave me a much clearer and more engaging view of electronics.I was particularly intrigued by the chapter on transistors,which explained their critical role as switches controlled by current.I explored the fundamental operation of Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), deepening my understanding of their role in amplification, switching and overall circuit behavior.To see transistors come into use,I completed a personal project where I designed a spinning tea cup using Autocad and modified an existing motor with a transistor using Tinkercad.I added a transistor to modulate motor speed using pulse width modulation,even though it wasn't necessary. This allowed me to experiment with a microcontroller,which required me to learn C++ to send digital on/off signals to the transistor.Although learning the language posed challenges,the reward was a deeper understanding of how code interacts with hardware and this raw connection with the hardware made electronics feel more intuitive which only sparked my interest in this branch of engineering further.\n\nAfter watching a video on BJTs by ElectroBOOM,I became curious about their limitations.I particularly noticed that BJTs require a constant current to stay on, so they consume power which leads to power loss. Moreover,if the base input current is too high this will cause a surge in emitter current and with the high potential difference this can cause potential overheating.I researched the different types of transistors and came across MOSFETs, which are voltage-controlled. Their efficiency,lower power consumption and better thermal management due to heatsinks made me realise how critical component selection is while designing a circuit.This comparative analysis helped develop my ability to think critically about engineering trade-offs.\n\nA BBC report on the Heathrow Airport fire on 20th March piqued my interest in electrical faults as I wondered how did this fault actually happen? Even though the exact cause is still unknown, an article on theconversation.com outlined possible issues including oil leaks, cyber-attacks,or overheating from a transformer.This raised questions for me about how large-scale electrical systems are engineered to be safe and reliable.I explored this further by watching a University of Bath lecture on sustainable electrical practices,where I learned about how UK transformers are designed to reduce resistance by using thick,highly conductive wire with short windings to minimise resistivity as much as possible.These techniques made it clear how theoretical principles are applied to ensure energy security for consumers in England.\n\nAway from academics,I worked with Hackney Council to help improve waste collection and disposal. This experience developed my communication skills as I was able to convey my ideas to those in senior positions as well as my organisation,time management and teamwork whilst doing tasks.These are essential skills in electrical engineering, where effective collaboration and clear communication are critical to developing and implementing technical solutions.I have also played competitive football for several years which has taught me self-discipline and the value of a collective effort.I believe these qualities will support me in the collaborative and problem-solving nature of electrical engineering, both at university and in my future career.\n\nMy personal projects and academic exploration have deepened my understanding of electronics and sparked a genuine interest in the challenges of designing efficient electrical systems.I am excited by the analytical and theoretical focus of engineering and I look forward to developing my mathematical and engineering abilities.",
