    "statement_full_text": "Growing up in a small town, I have always viewed cities as areas of success and opportunity. Intrigued if this perception was true, I turned to Glaeser's book 'Triumph of the City', where I was captivated by the story of Detroit's decline revealing that not all cities emulate this ideal. I reflected on how clustering of firms can drive innovation and economic growth, and think the most important agglomeration economies for Detroit are knowledge spillovers. Detroit's decline was multilayered, but I believe its main weakness was its inability to address the diminishing human capital that automotive assembly line production created, by reducing the need for cities to spread knowledge. This piqued my interest in urban economics and led me to dedicate my NEA on how the quality of life differs between two estates in Milton Keynes. I explored wealth distribution, using Spearman's rank to test the association between house prices and house area, and discovered that Beanhill had substantially cheaper housing than Shenley Church End. Beanhill was a centre of extreme deprivation, allowing me to see parallels with Glaeser's argument that cheap housing often attracts the poor. The desire to understand how urban growth interacts with the housing market motivates me to study Geography and Economics.\n\nAfter reading 'Rethinking the Economics of Land and Housing' by Collins, I learnt how land value largely accounts for exorbitant house prices. I was intrigued by the critique of neoclassical economics for conflating land with capital, despite its fixed supply and inability to respond to demand except through rising prices. To delve deeper, I attended a lecture by the University of Cambridge 'Exploring Residential Property Markets', where I learnt more about determinants of house prices. As I was posed with the question of how a new metro affects house or rent prices, I connected Ricardo and Smith's theory of economic rent - land values rise not only from the landowner's efforts, but from surrounding investment leading to higher rents. My growing interest in housing led me to explore solutions to the Hong Kong housing crisis in my EPQ. I reflected on how government land auctions inflate scarce land prices as a main source of government revenue. While recognising the fiscal need, I argued it should not outweigh adequate and affordable housing provision. I concluded that adaptive reuse of vacant industrial buildings, feasible given Hong Kong's post-1980s manufacturing decline, provides immediate relief with land reclamation to increase developable land. Drawing on Collin's view of land as a financial asset, I believe these measures must be coupled with vacancy taxes to curb speculation and ensure housing serves as shelter.\n\nVisiting my grandad who farmed the land in Kalampatti, a small village in India, I became aware of how closely people's livelihoods depend on the natural environment. This inspired me to watch Sukhdev's TED Talk 'Put a Value on Nature', where I discovered that the world is irretrievably losing natural capital at a rapid rate of $2-4 trillion annually due to the economic invisibility of nature. To explore how to address this, I attended a lecture by the University of Cambridge on 'Valuing Nature: Why and How?', where I learnt about how non-market valuation methods can incentivise conserving nature by assigning a monetary value for ecosystem services. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1998 is an example of how contingent valuation was used to assess the American public's willingness to pay to prevent another similar accident. However, I believe the value produced is not fully reliable, since contingent valuation introduces hypothetical bias as actual payments may differ from stated ones. I found revealed preference methods, such as replacement cost, more convincing, as they monetise ecosystem services by using real market behaviour through equating them with the manual cost that farmers like my grandad would otherwise incur for processes like pollination. Therefore, I think valuation is most useful when applied pragmatically in public spending decisions, as recognised in the UK's Green Book for cost-benefit analysis to ensure natural capital is accounted for.\n\nBeyond studies, I led my team in the Green Schools Challenge, where we placed 2nd with our proposal of NoteCycle, a digital solution to target excessive paper use and promote sustainability. Being the youngest member of my Parish Council's editorial team, I write articles that are published to 3000 homes and contribute to discussions about the development of our community. Engaging with different perspectives on issues such as housing has taught me to consider multiple stakeholders when evaluating policies at the intersection of Geography and Economics.",

    "statement_full_text": "My earliest role models had always shown an eagerness to know more, thus prompting me to have the same attitude. Naturally, this led to an acute interest in all things philosophical. To me, philosophy seeks to combat willful ignorance, forcing individuals to seek liberation from a life of delusion. It forces expansion of the mind through constant questioning. In philosophy, there is no absolute truth, only arguments for each side. This subjectivity is what deepened my interest in it; I am able to ponder concepts for hours on end without running out of perspectives. Throughout my academic life, this need to know more continued, and so when it came time to choose my A-level subjects, I wanted to pick something that would offer the same intellectual stimulation that philosophy did; leading me to pick psychology. Having little to no knowledge on this subject, I found approaches to explaining what drives behaviour particularly fascinating. The contrast between the Humanistic approach and the Cognitive approach let me understand how far psychological research has come, and how much further it can go.\n\nStudying A-level Psychology has changed my perspective in observing daily interactions. In understanding behaviour, I am able to apply behaviourist explanations of behaviour such as classical or operant conditioning. A-level Psychology has allowed me to rationalise behaviour of not only others but my own, using psychological concepts. It has given me perspective in understanding there may be several causes for an individual's choices. Freud's theory of psychosexual stages explains development from infancy to adulthood, giving me insight into people's actions, and how they are potentially rooted in early childhood experiences. Similarly, A-level Philosophy has nurtured my naturally inquisitive mind, allowing me to observe reality through the eyes of the greatest minds in history. Debating rationalism vs empiricism has triggered me to question what the primary source of knowledge truly is. This has inspired me to read through the works of Plato and Aristotle in their differing understandings of reality, and use this knowledge in debates of a priori and a posteriori knowledge. My A-level subjects have greatly helped me to improve my analytical skills. Teaching me to constantly be thorough in my explanations, I leave no stone unturned. More specifically, A-level Philosophy has taught me true evaluative skills, demonstrating that an argument can always be made the other way. Psychology has also been extremely useful in teaching me how to conceptualise knowledge and apply it to specific cases, thus allowing me to use said knowledge in my everyday life. These subjects have both nurtured and encouraged my love for reading and writing. Not only this, but they have forced me to constantly upgrade my writing style, making me unafraid of trying new formats. The subjective nature of Philosophy has dispelled my fear of \"getting it wrong\", which has helped me to become a better learner overall.\n\nIn developing my interest in these two subjects, I read The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt. The book demonstrates how ancient philosophical ideas can be deeply examined through contemporary psychological research. Haidt's metaphor of the rider and the elephant helped me directly confront the tension between reason and emotion, a central theme in discussions of free will and agency. What I found most compelling was the book's integration of philosophical reflection with empirical study, strengthening my belief that combining psychology and philosophy yields a more nuanced understanding of the human condition. Beyond academics, I have been an active participant in my school community. As a prefect and student council member, I developed greater confidence and leadership skills. These roles allowed me to collaborate with peers to effect positive change within the school. Serving as a diversity and mental health ambassador, I supported fellow students by: providing ongoing support, helping in organising initiatives such as culture days to help students from diverse backgrounds feel accepted. This experience broadened my understanding of mental health and wellbeing as I practiced active listening and engaged with a variety of perspectives and observed firsthand that questions of moral responsibility and care for the community are not merely theoretical, but are woven into everyday life. Collectively, these experiences have convinced me that the intersection of psychology and philosophy offers the most robust framework for understanding the principles and lived experiences that shape human life.",

    "statement_full_text": "With 8.06 billion people and 195 UN-recognised nations, the world functions in magnificently interesting but different ways. By studying PPE, I aspire to understand the systems behind such complex 'machines' and their interactions. It is commonly understood that democracy is about using the power of the people, for the people. However, Donald Trump's recent activities - exploiting Article II of the constitution (which sets out the powers of the President) to justify summarily dismissing federal officials and judges, asserting his authority over nearly all regulatory bodies and creating DOGE to undermine Congress' power - is a clear indication of his desire to centralise power. To me, this represents a threat to democracy. To learn more, I read 'How Democracies Die' by Levitsky and Ziblatt and reflected on the alarming similarities between Trump and the dictatorial former presidents of Argentina and Peru, who employed similar tactics to undermine the judicial system and subvert democracy. Moreover, I was disappointed by Trump's joyful acceptance of a $400 million plane from Qatar, as going against Congress to 'accept a present from a foreign state' is clearly unconstitutional. As Anderson outlines in 'Democracy or Oligarchy? Regulating Financial power', the 'referees of the game' should never be influenced by excessive monetary gains. Like Anderson, it is my opinion that the federal board needs to reassert control over government to maintain a democratic system in America.\n\nBeing in Sri Lanka during the 2022 economic chaos and directly experiencing the effects of poor policies, I became determined to understand the policy differences which cause mass contrast in wealth between countries such as the UK and Sri Lanka. Leading me to take on the Oxford edX course 'From Poverty To Prosperity: Understanding economic development'. The module on the effect of external influences on development particularly hooked me as I learnt the shocking prominence of corruption in private capital flows. Bribery involved in facilitating the exit of corrupt private capital via shell companies and tax havens amazed me, especially as Africa loses $200 billion a year by such corruption- double it's public aid inflow. Consequently reading 'Corruption, Institutions and Economic Development' by Aidt, I learnt that as corruption increases, growth in genuine wealth per capita (GWPC) decreases. After replicating the calculations using World Bank Data and the TI Index, I found this to be true for both the UK and Netherlands, in both cases as corruption increased- the growth of GWPC decreased. However, in Sri Lanka, as corruption increased, my calculations showed unusually high levels of GWPC. From also reading, 'Corruption and Government' by Ackerman, I learnt that this could potentially be to masking loots as 'education spending', which counts as net savings and is used to calculate GWPC.\n\nControversial discussions particularly engage me, prompting me to enter the Berggruen Institue Essay Competition on consciousness. Through research for this essay I developed a theory called the 'Intelligence Theory' where I argued that to be conscious is to think, and that thinking is a result of a brain's intelligence thus consciousness is due to intelligence. I built my theory by defining 'intelligence' as the ability of the brain to complete various actions mentally; 'thinking' as visual and auditory simulations from the brain. Reading '-Some Aspects of Merab Mamardashvili's theory of consciousness' by Gasparyan, allowed me to strengthen my argument as I criticised Mamardashvili's idea that 'we have no witness of our thinking experience and that thinking stops when it is witnessed'. I highlighted how there is no such thing, as inner monologues require a listener and visual simulations require a viewer. Thus by studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics, I hope to develop a better understanding of the world and how it fits together logically, ethically and practically.",

    "statement_full_text": "Moral responsibility looks different on a brain scan. The schism between the self we judge and the brain we measure became apparent when researching the stigma surrounding Cluster B personality disorders, and the subsequent lack of treatment options. Psychological explanations for behaviour; genetics, trauma, or disrupted attachment, provide scientific accounts of the human condition. But when someone's harmful actions are rooted in early developmental deficits, or anomalies in their brain structure, can we hold them ethically accountable as we would someone with typical neurological functioning? I found that many clinicians and the wider public respond more morally than medically: that these people are 'evil', not ill. But I don't think 'evil' explains anything; rather, it is what we say when we stop trying to. It is clear to me that science can and should be used to shape philosophical thought, including notions of justice, and this drives my continued study.\n\nBeing from a bilingual household, I find myself naturally drawn to the idea of language acquisition. Elements of A-level psychology, such as encoding specificity, apply to my everyday life seeing family members switch languages to discuss culturally specific concepts. Exploring this further, I read Boroditsky's 2001 study, showing how speaking different languages can alter perceptions of time and space. This suggested to me that language actively shapes, rather than simply conveys, thought. These concepts took on a new dimension when studying Wittgenstein's linguistic philosophy in Religious Studies, a topic I engaged with further during an academic session at Durham University on the private language argument. Applying my understanding of language perception helped me to appreciate the social nature of meaning. It allowed me to see private language not just as an abstract impossibility, but a reminder that meaning is inseparable from context, and our 'subjective' experiences are influenced and constrained by the shared linguistic forms we participate in.\n\nEconomics and Politics have deepened my quantitative and critical thinking skills. For instance, behavioural economics has shown me global consequences to psychological theory. Furthermore, having already studied Mill's philosophy, the liberalism topic in politics broadened my insight into freedom, power, and ethical intervention.\n\nMy strengths in research and academic writing were enhanced during the SDC residential programme at the University of Oxford. My essay, 'How psychological interventions can be used to promote moral behaviour' explored the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social decision-making, cognitive dissonance, and 'nudging' to resolve ethical issues in society. In the tutorial following this, I demonstrated the philosophical underpinnings of seemingly mundane social policy; debating concepts of free will, ethical responsibility within consumer-producer dynamics, and what it truly means to be 'moral'. Furthermore, I was challenged to see formal logic as inextricably linked to choice and fairness after a peer's essay on voting systems prompted me read De Swart's 'Philosophical and Mathematical Logic', which taught me concepts such as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and its application to democracy. This shifted logic from idea to impact, revealing how behaviour unfolds from a theoretical basis.\n\nI refined my data analysis skills and moral judgement within my work in the Developmental Intergroup Processes Lab at the University of Exeter, in which I researched cross-cultural moral development in children. This included interviewing participants as young as four, developing a framework to quantify open-ended ethical reasoning responses, and using SPSS to analyse the significance of our findings. I remain engaged with the lab, inspired by both the scientific rigour and ethical sensitivity used when studying socially complex issues; traits I aim to develop in studying Psychology and Philosophy.",

    "statement_full_text": "Witnessing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on my own mental health and that of others instilled in me an interest in the close link between someone's environment, brain activity and behaviour. Studying psychology will allow me to further my understanding of this intricate relationship, which I hope will lead me to a clinical career where I can use my passion to support the wellbeing of others.\n\nI explored how circumstance, specifically bullying, can impact mental health in my entry to the Northeastern University London essay competition, which I was a finalist in. Considering how my existing knowledge could reduce the broad repercussions on victims, bystanders and the bully, for example using positive punishment in operant conditioning to weaken unwanted behaviours, excited me at the prospect of applying psychology to solve real-world problems. Unresolved bullying can contribute to chronic stress in childhood, which risks violent behaviour later in life as explored by Dr Gwen Adsted in the 2024 BBC Reith Lectures. After listening to them, I reflected on the importance of not just viewing evil as an innate characteristic and instead situating extreme violence in its wider context to understand what leads to this response and how it can be prevented. I enjoy how this open-minded approach encouraged by psychology allows me to appreciate how individual differences and situational factors shape the subtleties of our actions and foster compassion for those different from me.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic inspired me to research recent influences on young people's mental health in my EPQ. Reading The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt to examine social media's harmful effects allowed me to critically reflect on how threats to wellbeing have evolved with technology's development and what this means for mitigating them, with cultural change and collective action being integral. In Nature though it is argued that Haidt has seen correlative data and assumed causation where there isn't, which I found a salient reminder that to understand mental illness and other behaviour it must be viewed as the culmination of multiple genetic and environmental elements.\n\nStudying hormones in A-level psychology alongside Haidt's exploration of why puberty is fundamental due to the increase in brain pruning and myelination drove me to further investigate how biological variables impact our functioning. Cordelia Fine's Testosterone Rex developed my understanding and presented why testosterone is no longer the polarising chemical it was once seen as. This view allows us to acknowledge that sex is not a crucial social divide, and by conveying this to children from a young age through gender-neutral toy marketing, the formation of developmental systems where women are seen as lower in status and having economic dependence on men may be reduced. As these ideas have been linked with domestic violence, this shows the potential for biological reasoning to direct social outcomes.\n\nDuring work experience in a research lab, I observed a fascinating discussion about open and closed science. It taught me the importance of open science in psychology, like pre-registration, but how it can be a challenge with participant groups such as those with intellectual disabilities; where people have a rare condition which could easily identify them, confidentiality is a crucial ethical consideration. I reviewed how I can further implement ethical guidelines as a longstanding volunteer with St John Ambulance, like managing public interest to maintain patient privacy.\n\nIn school I am a young wellbeing lead and wellbeing prefect, roles which have strengthened my desire to help others using empathy and active listening. Completing my grade 8 flute exam has developed my resilience, a useful skill for pursuing a career in a competitive, varied field like psychology.",
