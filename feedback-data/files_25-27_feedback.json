    "statement_full_text": "My fascination with the human mind and behaviour began on the day my mother fell ill, my emotions took over me and I sought to understand the drivers behind these complex feelings. I turned to psychology. 'Psychology Review' magazines combined with articles from 'Psychology Today' provided me with some answers. They allowed me to better understand my previously confusing emotions and solidify my appreciation for the study of human nature. The magazines enabled me to understand psychology's shifting research spotlight. However, reading several volumes made me realise that the subject's young nature leaves much ambiguity in explaining intricate behaviours. Each new discovery since the development of the study of the relationship between mind and behaviour within psychology has unveiled important findings on the nature of humans and yet also reveals just how little we know about it. The way that each credible, well-tested approach could be challenged by alternatives with differing strengths, captivated me.\n\nIn my EPQ, I considered cognitive psychological theory and its applications, integrating findings from articles, books. I was able to apply my polished writing skills from being a monthly blog writer for a therapy clinic while developing my understanding of psychology's real world use. My role leading the diversity sub-committee, planning our school's culture week let me demonstrate my creativity and problem solving skills in addition to the perseverance and capability to see them through. While my initial A-level results did not reflect my true ability, the experience has driven me to refine my approach in order for me to get the best results I know I can achieve. This shift in mindset and motivation helped me optimise and develop a consistent and disciplined work ethic demonstrated by my ability to balance maintaining high quality standards in my academic studies, endorsed by teachers, alongside my two part time jobs.\n\nWork experience within primary school and my part time job as a teaching assistant sparked my interest in how the principles of psychology are used to tailor education to each child's assessed cognitive development. This led me to an article by Eleanor Leigh that outlined the importance of addressing early-age psychological barriers to learning, to promote long-term wellbeing and success. The discovery showed me that psychology is all around us and sparked a newfound respect for the cognitive aspect of psychology. I then read Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', which developed my understanding of concepts like different thinking systems and cognitive tendencies. I learnt more on this topic when discussing with the director of 'Bristol CBT Clinic' during work experience with them. Outcomes of CBT consultations and assessments gave me insights into the clinic's operations and its use of cognitive strategies to disrupt unhealthy thought patterns. I worked with CBT therapists and trainee clinical psychologists to design a survey to identify traits linked with social anxiety for patient treatment. After reading Bryan Cook's, 'The Importance of Evidence-based Practice', I understand that if you wish to draw conclusions they need to be backed up by evidence. I initially began a small experiment on one participant to investigate the phonological similarity effect. Further, in my summer group project, I investigated the relationship between ASD and dyslexia and used an AQ test and nonsense reading task on 21 participants to measure the two disorders. We found a positive correlation, foreshadowed by a range of past studies. However the experiment introduced me to issues like co-morbidity and the difficulties of quantifying such unique and complicated disorders. This, along with reading Ben Goldacre's 'Bad Science' taught me about the importance of scientifically credible experiments and awareness of cognitive biases. The profound complexity of human behaviour and endless potential to uncover new truths about ourselves drives me to understand and explore beyond the boundaries of what we know.

I turned to psychology. 'Psychology Review' magazines combined with articles from 'Psychology Today' provided me with some answers. They allowed me to better understand my previously confusing emotions and solidify my appreciation for the study of human nature. The magazines enabled me to understand psychology's shifting research spotlight. However, reading several volumes made me realise that the subject's young nature leaves much ambiguity in explaining intricate behaviours. Each new discovery since the development of the study of the relationship between mind and behaviour within psychology has unveiled important findings on the nature of humans and yet also reveals just how little we know about it. The way that each credible, well-tested approach could be challenged by alternatives with differing strengths, captivated me.\n\nIn my EPQ, I considered cognitive psychological theory and its applications, integrating findings from articles, books. I was able to apply my polished writing skills from being a monthly blog writer for a therapy clinic while developing my understanding of psychology's real world use. My role leading the diversity sub-committee, planning our school's culture week let me demonstrate my creativity and problem solving skills in addition to the perseverance and capability to see them through. While my initial A-level results did not reflect my true ability, the experience has driven me to refine my approach in order for me to get the best results I know I can achieve. This shift in mindset and motivation helped me optimise and develop a consistent and disciplined work ethic demonstrated by my ability to balance maintaining high quality standards in my academic studies, endorsed by teachers, alongside my two part time jobs.\n\nWork experience within primary school and my part time job as a teaching assistant sparked my interest in how the principles of psychology are used to tailor education to each child's assessed cognitive development. This led me to an article by Eleanor Leigh that outlined the importance of addressing early-age psychological barriers to learning, to promote long-term wellbeing and success. The discovery showed me that psychology is all around us and sparked a newfound respect for the cognitive aspect of psychology. I then read Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', which developed my understanding of concepts like different thinking systems and cognitive tendencies. I learnt more on this topic when discussing with the director of 'Bristol CBT Clinic' during work experience with them. Outcomes of CBT consultations and assessments gave me insights into the clinic's operations and its use of cognitive strategies to disrupt unhealthy thought patterns. I worked with CBT therapists and trainee clinical psychologists to design a survey to identify traits linked with social anxiety for patient treatment. After reading Bryan Cook's, 'The Importance of Evidence-based Practice', I understand that if you wish to draw conclusions they need to be backed up by evidence. I initially began a small experiment on one participant to investigate the phonological similarity effect. Further, in my summer group project, I investigated the relationship between ASD and dyslexia and used an AQ test and nonsense reading task on 21 participants to measure the two disorders. We found a positive correlation, foreshadowed by a range of past studies. However the experiment introduced me to issues like co-morbidity and the difficulties of quantifying such unique and complicated disorders. This, along with reading Ben Goldacre's 'Bad Science' taught me about the importance of scientifically credible experiments and awareness of cognitive biases. The profound complexity of human behaviour and endless potential to uncover new truths about ourselves drives me to understand and explore beyond the boundaries of what we know.

    "statement_full_text": "During a lecture on Immunology and Molecular Pathologies, I encountered a topic that deeply captivated me: the concept of cancer immunoediting. I was puzzled by how this disease can not only overcome, but actively benefit from its interactions with the components of both innate and adaptive immunity to drive its own proliferation. The tumor appears almost as a sentient being, changing itself in response to the constant immune selection pressure placed on the unstable tumor cells held in \"equilibrium,\" which may then enter the \"escape\" phase.\n\nThis concept sparked my interest in understanding how cancer takes advantage of our own defense systems to turn them against themselves, such as in the case of upregulation of PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 receptors on T cells, leading to functional exhaustion and inhibition of anti-tumor activity. A similar mechanism works with TGF-beta, IL-10, and IDO.\n\nBuilding on this mechanism, I decided to focus my thesis on Immunology, specifically on the protumoral and antitumoral gene clusters of macrophages present in the metastatic liver environment. The basis for my work was an article, published both in Nature and on the National Institutes of Health website, titled \"Alterations in Inflammatory Macrophage Niche Drive Phenotypic and Functional Plasticity of Kupffer Cells,\" which highlights the heterogeneity of macrophage populations in liver metastasis.\n\nBefore starting my thesis work, I had already explored the concept of phenotypic alterations in macrophages induced by tumor signals during a Bioinformatics course. For this course, I chose to personally analyze, through Differential Expression (DESeq2), GO Enrichment Analysis, and GSEA, the samples from a study involving murine models divided into normal and tumor-bearing subjects, due to my personal interest in the topic. The study is titled \"CD169⁺ Lymph Node Macrophages Have Protective Functions in Mouse Breast Cancer Metastasis\" and can be found on the National Institutes of Health website. I obtained the raw data by consulting the Expression Atlas database, where it is listed as experiment E-MTAB-8482.\n\nI am extremely interested in this course because I come from a solid bioinformatics background, and the Oxford Department of Oncology seems like the perfect place for me to gain deeper insights into the topics I have already studied, but not yet fully explored to satisfy my curiosity and passion.\n\nMy work ethic reflects my enthusiasm for learning and facing challenges. During my first year of university, I privately tutored high school students while also serving as a student representative; a role I have continued every year of my Bachelor's degree. In the past year, I also began working as an assistant at the library of Experimental Medicine here at La Sapienza University, where I have further honed my organizational skills and ability to balance studying with other activities; traits I believe are essential to pursue a demanding academic path.\n\nI am eager to contribute to the Oxford community and use this opportunity to grow both as a researcher and as a critical thinker.",
