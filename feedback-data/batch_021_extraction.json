    "statement_full_text": "What interests me about computer science is how design choices at the smallest level from the design of an instruction set to the trade offs between speed and memory in algorithms can fundamentally shape the way systems work and evolve.  I have a particular interest in processor architecture, as it shows how design choices influence performance , energy efficiency and suitability for different purposes. Through hands-on experience with tools such as circuitverse, I have designed ALUs and registers to simulate CPU operations, broadening my understanding of how hardware executes instructions.\nTo stay up to date with the research in the field, I regularly watch channels such as veritasium and computerphile. One of my prominent interests is quantum computing, in which the use of superposition has the potential to revolutionise areas like financial modelling. This can be achieved by improving risk analysis, and has the potential to improve Reinforcement learning in training AI. Studying computer science will allow me the opportunity to build on my passion, develop my skills, and contribute something noteworthy to the field in the future.\n\nStudying  computer science has enabled me to develop my skills in algorithm design to plan viable solutions as well as in  problem decomposition and understanding  the interlink between hardware and software. My NEA has also taught me about various software development processes available for projects and the importance of following commercial standards for coding. This prepares me for real world, professional opportunities. To further my studies I read an article from MIT about a company called Cloudian which developed AI optimised storage systems. It described how computation (the process of analysing data) can be done within the storage system rather than sending data to and from a separate processor. This reduced delays and decreased the training time required of AI models. It also discussed real time vectorisation where raw data is instantly converted into arrays that AI algorithms can understand during data loading. This article showed me that computer science isn't just creating good algorithms, but includes improving the systems that support them. \n\nOutside of education, I took part in a work experience at ARM offices in Sheffield. I learnt about their partnerships with charities such as UNICEF to use power efficient technology in remote regions. Some of their projects included quality monitoring in Laos and drone mapping in Malawi for flood predictions. This influenced me to research why ARM technologies are so successful in their work in off grid communities. I found out that the use of a RISC based processor (a processor that uses a small and optimised set of instructions)  and dynamic voltage scaling (a technique which adjusts a processor's voltage and frequency depending on workload) allows devices to function efficiently with a reduced power supply. I also learnt  about big.little architecture where high performance cores handled intensive tasks while low power cores handled simpler tasks. This reduced energy consumption without sacrificing performance. From work experience and my research I understood how developments in computer science can allow technology to have a real world impact, even in communities affected by the digital divide. Outside of my studies, I took part in weekly volunteering at my local charity shop.I also co-led the team for a milkshake stand during a charity event hosted at my school.These activities developed my organisational and teamwork skills. Balancing these commitments alongside my studies have greatly improved my time management. Overall they have given me the transferrable skills required for degree level computer science\n\nSWFC - Working in a dynamic scale environment has improved my organisational skills as well as my teamwork and increased the efficiency of communications leading to an improved turnaround rate",

    "statement_full_text": "I am fascinated by the way financial systems influence economic stability, business strategy, and the everyday lives of individuals. Studying A-level Mathematics, Economics, and Business has developed my ability to reason quantitatively and think critically about how markets operate. In Economics, exploring the relationship between interest rates and inflation allowed me to analyse the Bank of England's recent decision to maintain a restrictive base rate despite slowing GDP growth. This sparked my curiosity about the balance between monetary stability and economic expansion a trade-off at the heart of both macroeconomic policy and corporate finance. My personal research into unemployment and behavioural finance deepened my interest in how human decision-making diverges from rational models, and how this can impact investment behaviour, risk assessment, and policy effectiveness. I am particularly drawn to corporate finance because of its ability to shape long-term business resilience and innovation through strategic capital allocation.\n\nComing to the UK at the age of ten from a working-class background made me acutely aware of the effects of socioeconomic inequality. Observing how access to financial education, resources, and opportunity can vary so widely has motivated me to explore financially sustainable strategies to address these disparities. I see the study of Accounting and Finance not only as an academic pursuit, but also as a means of creating more equitable systems that balance profitability with social responsibility.\n\nMy work placement at CTMP Accountants Ltd gave me first-hand experience in bookkeeping, financial reporting, and tax return preparation. This sharpened my attention to accuracy and regulatory compliance, while also showing how financial statements influence business decisions. Analysing a client's cash flow patterns, for example, allowed me to see how liquidity management can prevent solvency issues in small firms. Winning a Bronze Award in the Senior UKMT Maths Challenge improved my ability to identify patterns, break down complex problems, and apply structured reasoning skills directly transferable to investment modelling and forecasting.\n\nI expanded my exposure through virtual placements with PwC, KPMG, and Lloyd's Banking Group, where I explored portfolio diversification strategies and learned how scenario analysis can guide risk management. A \"Maths in Action\" lecture introduced me to statistical models that can be applied to market forecasting, while attending business and law conferences broadened my understanding of how regulation shapes financial markets. In my A-level Business coursework, I applied break-even analysis and net present value calculations to evaluate a manufacturing investment, weighing short-term liquidity pressures against long-term profitability. This combination of theoretical and applied work has reinforced my enthusiasm for integrating quantitative analysis with strategic judgement.\n\nLeadership roles as a Year 11 prefect and now as a senior student leader have strengthened my organisational and problem-solving abilities. Coordinating events required budgeting, prioritising resources, and making decisions under time constraints  skills that mirror project management in corporate settings. Balancing these commitments with my studies has taught me to work efficiently under pressure, a quality essential in high-stakes financial environments.\n\nAt university, I plan to engage deeply with modules in financial modelling, corporate strategy, and econometrics, while participating in finance and investment societies. I aim to take part in consulting projects and trading simulations to apply my knowledge in competitive, real-world contexts. My long-term ambition is to qualify as a chartered financial officer, advancing to roles such as Financial Manager or CFO, where I can combine data-driven decision-making with strategic planning to foster sustainable growth. This degree offers the intellectual challenge and professional preparation necessary for me to achieve these goals while contributing meaningfully to the academic and extracurricular life of the university.",

Operation by operation, calculating each mass balance, troubleshooting each ﬂow diagram, to ultimately create the most environmentally, economically and ethically efﬁcient process available. The dissection of complex systems, such as in a NileRed video on molecularly manipulating gloves into grape soda, initially crystallised my curiosity, and inspired me to start thinking about how everyday processes can be broken down and reﬁned, in order to provide a tangible impact. \n\nIngenia's article on forever chemicals forced me to question my own effect environmentally - even through waterproof clothing. Gore-Tex, a well-known brand's famous waterproof technology contains PFAS, which I discovered can quickly pollute our bodies and our environment. Recognising PFAS structural resemblance to CFCs and having learned of their harmful effects, I was concerned about the harm wearing my everyday jacket caused. After further research, I was provided with a great example of Chemical Engineering, where I learned of the brand's research into a PFAS-free membrane using expanded polyethylene's microporous structure, allowing them to slowly achieve their 2050 carbon neutrality goal. This transition helped reshape the way I view my footprint, and rethink how things are made, not just used. \n\nTaking part in the CHAS programme led by Cambridge taught me to face a series of unprecedented calculations, in key areas like thermodynamics, and challenged my understanding of my A-level subjects. Ultimately, I presented a small lecture about green hydrogen. I researched and talked about large-scale hydrogen hubs, new production methods like photoelectrochemical water splitting, and hydrogen's potential across multiple industries, such as aviation, or current electric vehicle applications, like the Toyota Mirai, using measures like the TRL scale.  \n\nThrough my work experience at Pharmaron, I learned more about materials and was able to directly compare my school's synthesis of aspirin to a company on a manufacturing scale. After synthesising, I determined my purity using HPLC, and compared my data to reference data, and was able to gain around 95% purity. Further techniques like FTIR, XRPD, and microscopy, gave me insight on modern approaches in pharmacy, compared to me and my classmates using school lab resources. Scaling this up from a classroom level, exposed me to chemical challenges, such as maintaining purity white optimising reaction time, or temperature trade-offs. Ultimately, after formulating and testing the dissolution of my tablet, I conducted a report, which taught me the transformation of raw materials into a product suitable for human use, in a hands-on environment.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1 \nDuring  the  political  upheaval  of  Hong  Kong,  I  stood  there  watching  the  society  I  grew  up  in struggle  with  legal  and  political  instability.  Through  these  turbulent  times  as tensions between China and Hong Kong intensified, I sought to comprehend the roots of this political dissonance. It made me aware of the stark differences in the legal frameworks of China and western countries (including Hong Kong). Whereas most countries are governed by the rule of law, China operates under rule by law. In reading Bingham's The Rule of Law and attending law tutorials, I learned about  his  8  principles,  considered  a  cornerstone  of  legal  philosophy,  which  China's  system contradicts entirely, therefore answering my initial question. Works by Prof. Cohen and Shitong Qiao  further  deepened  my  understanding.  Qiao,  in  particular,  highlighted how justice in China often emerges not through formal legal rights but through social norms, blurring the line between legality  and  legitimacy.  However,  if  such  a  system delivers economic success and order, can it truly  be  called  unjust?  When  I  revisit  Bingham's  ideas,  which  revolve  around  liberty,  fairness and  equality.  I  understood  that  without  legal  restraint,  governments  who remain above the law can't  deliver  true  justice.  Acknowledging  its  economic  success,  can  one truly admire a system that disregards justice to its citizens. Having explored this issue, it reshaped my views on law as plainly a set of rules, but a means to protect our values.  \n\nQuestion 2  \nThrough  A  Level  Psychology,  I  learned  about  conformity.  Why  do  people  conform?  It's fear—fear  of  consequences,  social  backlash  and  authority  figures.  In  recent  years,the government, also the authority figure, has intensified hate speech regulations increasingly, often determining the line between free speech and hate speech, restraining what people can or cannot say,  now  even  arresting  citizens  for  tweets,  memes  and  comments.  At  the  same  time,  social media plays an influential role in shaping our culture and social behavior. However, it also brings unspoken pressures, where many people are afraid to share their thoughts, as harassment, public backlash,  or  algorithmic  silencing  often  leads  them  to  self  censor.  Although  this  may  not constitute  direct  state censorship, such pressures raise critical questions about the true extent of free  speech.  Timothy  Garton  Ash,  in  his  book,  refers  to  this  as  the  \"iceberg  effect\"—an atmosphere  in which people self-censor, not because they are legally compelled to, but because they fear the consequences of speaking freely. Therefore, they conform to the norm. The biggest factor  in  why  this  book  resonated  with me is that it is relatively new, quite focused on internet speech, and takes into account more recent issues. What I took most to heart was his perspective of 'combating harmful speech with more speech', and his liberal stance on free expression, both are views which lots of youtube political figures I watch hold. \n\nQuestion 3 \n\nParticipating  in  Mooting  and  Mock Trial Competition solidified my interest in law, it made me realize how the phrasing of a sentence or narrative can make or break a case. As Bryan A. Garner says, \"Words are the lawyers' tools. The sharpness of these tools can cut both ways.\" This taught me how vital crafting a compelling opening and closing statements are. How I sway   the jury by relying  on  concise  phrasing  and  storytelling  to  frame  the  narrative  really  appealed  to  me.  In Jordan Peterson's Rule 10 of 12 Rules for Life, \"Precision in Speech\" resonated with me not only in  day  to  day  life,  but  especially  in  cross-examination;  it  shows  how  precise  questioning  can guide  a  witness's  response,  pinpointing inconsistencies, strengthening your credibility. Through trial  and  error,  I  learned  to  adapt  beyond  prepared  scripts  to  suit  different  witnesses  and  to strategically  challenge  contradictions  when  they  arise.  Most  importantly,  the  courtroom-like experience  allowed  me  to  fully  embrace  the  role  of  a  lawyer,  fueling  my  desire  to  continue exploring the legal field. \n\nMany people outside the legal profession talk about its shine and glamour, expecting everyone to be  like Harvey Specter, which can't be further from the truth. During my internships, I handled filings,  drafted  documents  and  communicated  with  clients.  The  work  required  real effort, long hours  and without glamour, but it also demanded precision, perseverance, and client interaction that  wasn't  all  pretty.  I  had  already  developed  resilience  through  sports  and  precision  through music,  but  these  experiences  taught  me  how  to  grind,  how  to  complete  what  many  would consider  monotonous  work,  without  the  adrenaline  fuelling  yourself,  and  yet  maintain  high standards, which really allowed me to grasp the day to day of a lawyer.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1 \n\nI became curious about   exploring the political dissonance between Hong Kong and China when I  saw   peers  of  mine  were  protesting.  It  shined  a  light  on  the  moral  foundations  of  two  legal philosophies:  rule  of  law  and rule by law. As courts in China lack judicial independence, I saw first hand how the Chinese Communist Party weaponized the legal system  to persecute people it deemed threats to the regime. Articles by Donald Clarke deepened my understanding on how the vagueness  ingrained  in  Chinese  laws  creates  uncertainty,  undermining  citizens'  clarity  on their rights. However, if the legal system employed by China delivers economic success and order, can it  truly  be  called  immoral?   In  search  of  answers,  I  read Sir Tom Bingham's The Rule of Law, which provides   a framework on a fair legal system. Reading this piece lead me to conclude that,  as  the  Chinese  government  operates  without  legal restraint from the judiciary, it cannot deliver true justice. Thinking deeply about this issue has reshaped my view of law as not merely a set of rules, but rather a means to protect our values. \n\nQuestion 2 \n\nIn summer 2025, I attended an Oxford Law summer course, where I examined Timothy Garton Ash's  \"Free  Speech\".  In  this  piece,  the  author  defends  classical  liberal  values  for  free speech. Specifically,  he  argues  that  speech  should  be  countered  with  more  speech,  a  stance  which strongly  resonates  with  me.  While  it  is  clear  that  speech  can  inflict  significant  psychological harm,  it  raises  a  fundamental  question,  should  a  fundamental  human  right  be  curtailed  in  the interest of the possibility of causing offence? \n\nAsh  discusses  this  when  he  mentions  China's  \"Orwellian\"  censorship  apparatus,  in  which  the government controls every aspect of online content in the name of national security. Notably, this censorship  apparatus  was  used  to  prevent  dissenters  from  exposing  globally  significant  news, like when covid 19 whistleblowers disappeared trying to warn people of the spread of virus. .  \n\nMy fascination with the topic of free speech led me to champion this issue in  my school's ECHR MUN.  As  a  UK  delegate,  I  researched  Liberty  and Others v. United Kingdom and Big Brother Watch and Others v. United Kingdom, to understand how a balance between individual rights and collective  security  can  be  achieved.  Both  cases  revolved  around  Article  8  as  a  qualified right. Meaning  for  purposes  of  national  security,  the  government  may  interfere  with  an  individual's privacy  if  the  interference  is  subject  to  rigorous  checks  and  adequate  legal  safeguards.  This reshaped  my  perspective  on  how  the  law  balances  the  protection  of  civil  liberties  with  state interests. \n\nQuestion 3 \n\nParticipating  in  a  Mooting  Competition  solidified  my  interest  in  law.  I  learned  that  good advocacy  requires  building  a  compelling  narrative  and  engaging  emotionally  with  jurors, securing  a  win  through  engaging  on  both a personal and professional level. In the finals of the mooting  competition,  my  team  represented  the  defence  in a rape case involving 2 drunk teens, where  we  focused  on  the  arguement  of  mutual  intoxication.  During  cross  examination,  we established the victim's   state of intoxication and acts of apparent consent. By demonstrating the level of intoxication of both parties, behaviours the victim exhibited as well as   her fondness of the defendant, we were successful in raising reasonable doubt, resulting in our win. In navigating this  case,  where  evidence  was  scarce  and  definitions  were  murky,  I  realized  that  a  successful   lawyer is a good storyteller who understands the jury and their reservations \n\nIn addition to my experience in mooting, I witnessed the power of interpersonal dynamics in  my internship  at  Lester  Dominic  Solicitors,  where I sat in on client meetings and watched partners change their tactics when dealing with different clients. During an execution of will I witnessed, a heated argument erupted regarding discrepancies in the amount inherited. The partner, whom I shadowed, responded calmly and provided solutions quickly. It showed me once again that being a  lawyer  isn't  just  about  knowing the law but also the client. The complementary nature of the two skills propels me to study law.",

During  cross  examination,  we established the victim's   state of intoxication and acts of apparent consent. By demonstrating the level of intoxication of both parties, behaviours the victim exhibited as well as   her fondness of the defendant, we were successful in raising reasonable doubt, resulting in our win.",

You're going for a very academic degree course, but as a lawyer there's still ethics involved. If you could rephrase to have more of an academic angle - as you're explaining this, you're saying we established this and that, but it's not like 'we looked at these past cases and used that as precedent' or mentioning articles you read. You haven't mentioned any sources that inspired you or how you knew this would work within the confines of law.",
