    "statement_full_text": "Q1\nMy drive to study PPE stems from its opportunity to shape my critical analysis and exploration through its multidisciplinary examination of world events, thought, and the art of argumentation. When I attended St John's College's PPE Study Day, Alison Hill's lecture on whether equality matters involved a utilisation of Rawl's vale of ignorance. I concluded that fairness in society requires not just the philosophical notion of equality but also the political facet of influence. The concept of a society where there is a stark inequality of wealth distribution, and not knowing where one would end up made me decide that there does lie responsibility for prosperous individuals and the government to facilitate a system of redistribution. This led me to read an academic article in the Attlee government's social policy. I was particularly drawn to the creation of the welfare state but I disagreed with the article's conclusion that these were 'modest reforms' and that the success in the past is 'making things difficult for us now'. This is because of the risk that come with 'going private' with healthcare that were exhibited to me in a BBC documentary: namely the inadequate facilities and staffing which does not guarantee recovery or survival and it can give false hope to patients. Therefore, the NHS should be greatly prized as a symbol of fairness due to its universal access.\n\nQ2\nMy fascination for Utilitarianism originated from coming across the trolley problem in Religious Studies. I covered this further when completing Harvard University's MOOC on Justice, where I came across Jeremy Bentham's idea of Utilitarianism as maximising pleasure over pain in an attempt to maximise utility. Whilst I disagree that pleasure and pain can be measured effectively enough to be meaningful, if there were to measure a variable for the sake of deciding on policy, pleasure and pain ought to not be the only two aspects that should be considered when conducting cost benefit analysis by governments, for example. Humans contain a greater intellectual and emotional complexity to simply assert that these two variables are the most relevant and look at them in a binary manner.\n\nIn the process of completing the MOOC I was surprised to find that the result of the Phillip Moris study which was a cost benefit analysis for smoking in the Czech Republic led to the conclusion that there was a net finance gain of $147 million a year. Reading an academic article that critiqued this I was not surprised to find that there were erroneous assumptions that were made. As an inaugural recipient as the Ashmolean Economics tutorials at my school, I had argued in support in response to the question: 'Economics is wrong but sometimes useful' where I argued that the assumptions made in Economics can often lead to misleading conclusions which can lead to not getting closer to the truth and leaving the public with uncertainty, as was the case with HS2. The fact that Philip Moris used their philanthropy as a source of lobbying was counter-intuitive morally though it was economically justified on an individualistic basis. Answering Caius Explore's essay competition question on whether lobbying is good or bad for the economy and society I concluded that lobbying is especially bad for society as it leads to a degradation in societal welfare and that it harms the economy by decreasing productivity and increasing barriers to entry for new firms due to rent seeking that takes place. This diverts resources toward political influence according to Bombardini and Trebbi's paper on empirical models of lobbying.\n\nQ3\nEntering the St John's Poster competition on the theme of imitation, I pursued an exploration into my question of whether moral virtue can be developed through imitation alone. Whereas I originally strongly agreed with Aristotle's ideas in Nichomachean Ethics, that by observing and imitating role models one's character can be developed since \"We become just by doing just acts\", I no longer think that someone can be truly be seen as just only due to their outward actions. Intention has to conjoin the action. Kant's Categorial imperitative which incorporates reason and intention provides a better guideline for moral actions.\n\nWhen I read Dharshini David's The Almighty Dollar, learning about China's investment in countries such as Ethiopia linked to the resistance against giving aid in the fear that this would create dependency. Whilst I think that tied aid is a means to exploit countries need of assistance, I think that prosperous individuals in prosperous countries have a responsibility to redistribute their wealth. This led to my curiosity in effective altruism where I wanted to know if its focus on rationality was effective in the sense of being able to harness donations. Thus, I conducted a project where I investigated the extent to which emotions influence giving. I concluded that giving should be celebrated and it should not be done so strictly as it will drive people away from this philosophy, and when emotion is utilised in the process of persuasion, it can encourage charitable giving.\n\nEmotions can also be exploited. I witnessed this in the wake of the 2024 Summer riots that were the result of misinformation spreading rapidly through social media. In my entry for the Northeastern University essay competition answering \"Digital technology is fundamentally changing politics. Discuss.\" I argued that through this medium of social media which virtually everyone has access to, transmitting information as well as visual imagery on a mass scale means that people can be propelled to irrationally cause destruction. The inflammatory language that is used plays on people's emotions and causes division. Listening to Politics Weekly's podcast episode about what we have learned a year on from the riots, I initially thought that there is not much that can be done because it would be too repressive to over-regulate social media. However, I was intrigued to find out that the Home Office sometimes does not inform local authorities of when they will move asylum seekers to local hotels, wheras when a local authority is informed then they can inform the citizens of the area. This discourse allows for more peace, demonstrating that accurate information getting to the public is essential in maintaining understanding between all parties.\n\nPPE offers the discipline to pursue an understanding of the mechanisms that create a fair society and this real-world relevance motivates me.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nI discovered my love for animals when I was paired with Ruby during Equine Therapy. Caring for her gave me a sense of purpose and direction through challenging times of my health. While there, I also completed AQA award scheme certificates about horse stables, management and grooming which laid a foundation of curiosity and knowledge into the veterinary profession. I witnessed and experienced the impact animals have on supporting well-being in humans. The sense of achievement I gained from relating with Ruby has left me with compassion and has driven my interest to pursue a veterinary career.\n\nQuestion 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nI enjoy independently researching different diseases like Hemangiosarcoma in dogs once I discovered that my friends dog struggled with it. The limited treatment options and the fast growth tumor on the lining of blood vessels led me to read Jennings and Premanandan's 'Veterinary Histology', which explained the structure of blood vessels. I learnt about the importance of the endothelial cells, their function and the tumor makes the endothelial cells unable to hold blood well in the vessels allowing them to rupture and bleed which can cause death. By reading James Heriot's book 'The God Lord Made Them All' I was particularly struck by the challenges and responsibility of transporting animals abroad. Having to navigate global regulations and ensure animal welfare, how a vet plays a vital role in protecting animal rights. I watched a documentary, 'The Secret Life of a Penguin'. This educated me on how penguins must adapt to their environment during the harsh weather changes bringing the realization that a vet needs to understand normal animal behaviors in their natural habitats before dealing with sick animals to compare the difference.\n\nQuestion 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education and why are these experiences useful?\nNetball has improved my teamwork, while boxing and personal training keep me fit, important for the stress relief a vet constantly needs.\n\nI have actively sought work experiences in the veterinary sector, from lambing and working in a dairy farm to volunteering at horse stables, city farms and small animal hospitals.\n\nDuring Lambing work experience I saw the growth of lambs and their different development stages, seeing their day growth, as well as assisting with births, monitoring ewes, bottle feeding and tube feeding the weaker lambs. All increased my knowledge of animal husbandry and it reinforced to me that I work well within a team to ensure the sheep get the best possible care. I particularly enjoyed experiencing the unpredictability of farming, seeing the urgency of problems that come during lambing and solving them. It all left me feeling fulfilled, excited and determined to become a vet. I also realised that I would love to work on an independent farm, where animals are looked after well.\n\nAt the RVC I completed The Sutton Trust Summer School, I particularly enjoyed learning about the journey that animals had from being rescued and unwell to full recovery. I enjoyed learning about reptiles, which was a new experience for me and which enabled me to improve my research skills when I researched egg binding, sourcing several reliable references and preparing a presentation.\n\nA Tibial Plateau Levelling Osteotomy was fascinating; I saw how carefully they placed the screws and the complexity of the surgery. I loved problem solving, seeing how things fit together and how a few screws can make such a difference to a dog's mobility and quality of life. I was disturbed by the neutering of a pregnant homeless cat. The vets and nurses explained this was a common procedure, despite the danger of complications like hernia. This highlighted for me the ethical dilemmas vets must confront. Another cat in liver and renal failure received 4 days' palliative care; putting her to sleep was the kindest option but her owners found this deeply upsetting. I realized how the vet must balance the welfare needs of the animal and those of the owners, showing compassion and empathy throughout the whole process. Taking the paw prints and shaving some of the fur felt very meaningful, keeping the cat's memory alive. All this fires my ambition to serve and protect animals in a career as a vet.",

    "statement_full_text": "I love animals and see a career as a vet as the ideal way to care for and protect them. I discovered my love for animals when in equine therapy I was paired with a horse, Ruby, and learned about equine care and common diseases. The compassion, care and bond I have developed during work experience has driven my interest and sense of purpose. As a vet I hope to take full responsibility for the animals in my care, choosing the medication and correct treatment.\n\nA-Level Biology and Chemistry have given me a thorough grounding in human anatomy and physiology, allowing me to identify specific comparisons in different types of animals. Maths is training my quantitative problem-solving skills. I enjoy independently researching different diseases like Hemangiosarcoma in dogs. The limited treatment options and the fast growth tumour on the lining of blood vessels led me to read Jennings and Premanandan's 'Veterinary Histology', which explained the structure of blood vessels. I went on to research the Maltipoo breed and common diseases of dogs. James Heriot's 'Every Living Thing', 'The Good Lord Made Them All' and 'All Creatures Great and Small' and his TV shows increased my interest, as did a Disney Plus documentary, 'The Secret Life of Penguins'. I have also completed an online course on 'Do you have what it takes to be a veterinarian?'\n\nNetball has improved my teamwork, while boxing and personal training keep me fit, important for the stress relief a vet constantly needs. On lambing work experience I increased my empathy with animals, tube- and bottle-fed some sick lambs, and injected calcium and magnesium into a sick lamb. When a lamb was born, we sprayed iodine in the umbilical cord to prevent infection. I saw a ewe reject her lamb, which was fostered by another lamb, after rubbing the amniotic fluid to get the new ewe to accept the lamb.\n\nAt the RVC's SSTS, I learnt about reptiles, spent a day in the farm learning about dairy cows, the volume of milk produced, and horn removal. I also learnt how to hold a chicken correctly to examine the feet and wings. I discovered the 6 basics of life: light, shelter, food, water, air and space. I learnt to pin down sheep to check the hoofs and udder, and did body scoring, using their teeth to tell the age. At equine I learnt how to put a headcollar and rug onto a horse, practising first on a mannequin before performing the procedure on a horse. I saw the various diagnosis images (CT, Xray, MRI and scintigraphy) offered in the equine referral hospital and examined ligaments, tendons and bones in the horse's legs. I listened to the horse's heart, lungs and bowels and learnt how to examine a horse for temperature, heart rate, breathing rate. On a house projection about snakes, I researched egg binding and improved my research skills. In the clinical-skills lab I practised bandaging a mannequin dog, practised doing the surgeon knot and learnt how to gown up and put on gloves post-sterilization.\n\nA TPLO was fascinating; I saw how carefully they placed the screws and the complexity of the surgery. I loved the problem solving, seeing how things fit together and how a few screws can make such a difference to a dog's mobility and quality of life. I was disturbed by the neutering of a pregnant homeless cat. The vets and nurses explained this was a common procedure, despite the danger of complications like hernia.

    "statement_full_text": "When I think of sustainability, I do not picture solar panels or recycling; I think of a person, Gro Harlem Brundtland. As Norway's first female Prime Minister, former Director of WHO, and author of Our Common Future (Oxford University Press, 1987), she has been a trailblazer for current and future sustainability professionals—and a personal role model to me. Her work made me realise how sustainability is the backbone of Scandinavian culture, and with my curiosity, I wanted to explore further beyond what felt familiar to learn how sustainability was conceptualised abroad.\n\nI therefore left my small hometown in northern Norway and have so far studied and worked across three continents, and learned to speak in a foreign language. This has allowed me to explore two key aspects: 1) how sustainability is practised globally across cultures, and 2) how I see myself as being a part of making impactful, positive change for current and future generations.\n\nMy journey began in high school, where I co-founded a youth business offering eco-friendly interior design. It was the first time I saw how values and perceptions shape sustainable choices, and how they vary amongst individuals. This set me on a quest to explore how sustainability is understood and practised globally. I therefore decided to leave the comfort of the small town I grew up in, Bodø, and move to the United States to enhance my academic English skills and immerse myself in international perspectives. There, I joined the Hawaiian Oceans project, researching ocean plastic pollution.\n\nOne vivid image from this project stayed with me—birds lying dead in their nests, their guts exposed and filled with plastic items they had eaten. Witnessing this made me question why sustainability initiatives succeed or fail, and it also led me to reflect on my own footprint and impact on nature. It sparked my interest in the role of communicating change, overcoming cultural biases, and the role of institutions in facilitating applied action. This marked the beginning of a growing self-awareness that would come to shape my academic and professional path.\n\nUpon returning to Norway, I was eager to build professional experience while developing practical leadership skills. I joined L'Oréal, progressing to Counter Manager within 2 months, and to acting Domestic Brand Manager 1.5 years later. In these roles, I cultivated a leadership style emphasising active listening, individual strengths, and values-based motivation. During this time, the adoption of the Paris Agreement served as a crucial reminder of the challenges I had witnessed in Hawaii, prompting me to explore environmental management at an academic level.\n\nTo pursue this academic ambition, I relocated to Australia, a new continent, to further deepen my understanding of international perspectives. There, I undertake a Bachelor of Environmental Management at the University of Queensland (UQ). UQ's strong global reputation and top-ranked environmental faculty provided an exhilarating environment where I honed my research techniques, critical thinking, and time management skills.\n\nWhile my early results reflected the challenge of adjusting to a new academic environment shaped by COVID-19, compounded by navigating the demands of studying with dyslexia, I steadily improved and ultimately achieved consistent high distinctions and distinctions as I grew in confidence and ability. Building on this, I completed an honours thesis exploring public perceptions of fossil fuels and decarbonisation policies. This research deepened my understanding of behavioural psychology, social identity, and policy resistance. It revealed a critical gap between ambitious Net Zero and Sustainable Development (NZSD) initiatives, and the willingness of certain demographic groups and organisations to embrace them.\n\nThis experience reinforced my belief that human-centred frameworks and adaptive communication are essential for translating technical sustainability strategies into meaningful, widely accepted action. It also made me recognise the need for emotionally intelligent leadership.\n\nI therefore joined the LeadHers Program at UQ — a leadership program for women. This experience reshaped my view of leadership as not merely positional, but as the capacity to influence through clarity, empathy, and purpose. I got to practise this while serving as the team leader for a large-scale group project, where empathy was key to successfully guiding the team through collaborative challenges—resulting in high distinction.\n\nFurthermore, I was eager to apply what I had learned academically and intellectually in a corporate environment. I interned at Queensland Trust for Nature, where I developed an interactive presentation for South Bank Corporation's precinct masterplan, proposing new built environment features deeply rooted in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The presentation was so well-received by the corporation that it led to a role in their team to assist with integrating the SDGs into biodiversity and decarbonisation planning.\n\nBalancing rigorous academic demands with corporate responsibilities during this period further strengthened my resilience and ability to manage priorities, resulting in graduation with a first-class honours degree, the Dean's Commendation Award, and a role as an environmental consultant at Arup.\n\nAt Arup, I have been recognised for my ability to translate complex technical data into strategic narratives for multidisciplinary teams. As co-chair of the OvaGreen committee, I initiate impactful action such as improving waste stream communication, which earned me a nomination for Arup's Sustainability Award. As co-chair of the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion committee, I work to implement reproductive leave and improve resources for neurodivergent employees. This has allowed me to practice inclusive leadership, supporting environmental, social, and economic sustainability.\n\nTo further enhance my professional insights, I joined the Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand (EIANZ), regularly attending expert panel Q&A sessions where I appreciate both industry insight and stories about personal growth. Additionally, independent readings like Dan Ariely's Misbelief and podcasts like The Circular Economy Show have enriched my perspectives on how different groups of people perceive information, cognitive biases and discussions on making circular behaviour irresistible.\n\nAdditionally, I sought out conversations with sustainability professionals at leading global companies, including L'Oréal and IKEA, to gain direct insight into what skillsets they will need in the next decade from future NZSD professionals, which has refined my understanding of the landscape I aspire to influence. This intellectual curiosity reflects my ability to critically engage with complex interdisciplinary knowledge and apply it to real-world NZSD challenges.\n\nBuilding on these experiences, I recognise that despite global progress, substantial gaps remain, particularly in translating NZSD intent into widely embraced societal and organisational practices. My professional, academic and leadership experiences have taught me the urgent need for creative solutions and effective communication that bridge NZSD intent with behavioural acceptance, as well as the need to recognise how a modern world where AI is embracing our lives, emotional intelligence needs to be embraced in leadership.\n\nMy experiences and ambitions lead me to Oxford's MSc in Sustainability, Enterprise, and the Environment (SEE), which offers precisely the interdisciplinary environment, robust enterprise engagement, and practical methodologies I seek — particularly the Enterprise Forum and Business Case Seminars. Learning alongside leading experts and peers will equip me to holistically address today's sustainability challenges as a capable and influential leader. At Oxford, I aim to deepen my understanding of the groups we seek to influence and develop well-adapted solutions for large-scale NZSD initiatives, such as the European Green Deal (EU's continental net-zero strategy).\n\nI eagerly anticipate this next chapter as I am not just well-equipped and prepared to devote the time, effort and skill needed to continue Oxford's pioneering work—I am also guided by Brundtland's principles of \"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\".",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course/subject?\n\nMy earliest role models had always shown an eagerness to know more, thus prompting me to have the same attitude. Naturally, this led to an acute interest in all things philosophical. To me, philosophy seeks to combat willful ignorance, forcing individuals to seek liberation from a life of delusion. It forces expansion of the mind through constant questioning. In philosophy, there is no absolute truth, only arguments for each side. This subjectivity is what deepened my interest in it; I am able to ponder concepts for hours on end without running out of perspectives. Throughout my academic life, this need to know more continued, and so when it came time to choose my A-level subjects, I wanted to pick something that would offer the same intellectual stimulation that philosophy did; leading me to pick psychology.\n\nHaving little to no knowledge on this subject, I found approaches to explaining what drives behaviour particularly fascinating. The contrast between the Humanistic approach and the Cognitive approach let me understand how far psychological research has come, and how much further it can go.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course/subject?\n\nStudying A-level Psychology has changed my perspective in observing daily interactions. In understanding behaviour, I am able to apply behaviourist explanations of behaviour such as classical or operant conditioning. A-level Psychology has allowed me to rationalise behaviour of not only others but my own, using psychological concepts. It has given me perspective in understanding there may be several causes for an individual's choices. Freud's theory of psychosexual stages explains development from infancy to adulthood, giving me insight into people's actions, and how they are potentially rooted in early childhood experiences.\n\nSimilarly, A-level Philosophy has nurtured my naturally inquisitive mind, allowing me to observe reality through the eyes of the greatest minds in history. Debating rationalism vs empiricism has triggered me to question what the primary source of knowledge truly is. This has inspired me to read through the works of Plato and Aristotle in their differing understandings of reality, and use this knowledge in debates of a priori and a posteriori knowledge.\n\nMy A-level subjects have greatly helped me to improve my analytical skills. Teaching me to constantly be thorough in my explanations, I leave no stone unturned. More specifically, A-level Philosophy has taught me true evaluative skills, demonstrating that an argument can always be made the other way. Psychology has also been extremely useful in teaching me how to conceptualise knowledge and apply it to specific cases, thus allowing me to use said knowledge in my everyday life. These subjects have both nurtured and encouraged my love for reading and writing. Not only this, but they have forced me to constantly upgrade my writing style, making me unafraid of trying new formats. The subjective nature of Philosophy has dispelled my fear of \"getting it wrong\", which has helped me to become a better learner overall.\n\nWhat else have you done outside of studies that qualifies you for this course?\n\nIn developing my interest in these two subjects, I read The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt. The book demonstrates how ancient philosophical ideas can be deeply examined through contemporary psychological research. Haidt's metaphor of the rider and the elephant helped me directly confront the tension between reason and emotion, a central theme in discussions of free will and agency. What I found most compelling was the book's integration of philosophical reflection with empirical study, strengthening my belief that combining psychology and philosophy yields a more nuanced understanding of the human condition.\n\nBeyond academics, I have been an active participant in my school community. As a prefect and student council member, I developed greater confidence and leadership skills. These roles allowed me to collaborate with peers to effect positive change within the school. Serving as a diversity and mental health ambassador, I supported fellow students by: providing ongoing support, helping in organising initiatives such as culture days to help students from diverse backgrounds feel accepted. This experience broadened my understanding of mental health and wellbeing as I practiced active listening and engaged with a variety of perspectives and observed firsthand that questions of moral responsibility and care for the community are not merely theoretical, but are woven into everyday life.\n\nCollectively, these experiences have convinced me that the intersection of psychology and philosophy offers the most robust framework for understanding the principles and lived experiences that shape human life.",
