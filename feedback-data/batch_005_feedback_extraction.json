    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course/subject?\n\"The highway toward understanding climate change stretches off into the distance...Our future will be much brighter if we can traverse this highway before we are overtaken by changing climate.\" States Richard B Alley in \"The Two-Mile Time Machine\". In this book, Alley discusses ice cores reflecting on abrupt climate changes in Earth's past and how to approach our climate-changing future. Alley highlights the global physical pump, a concept I had learnt in A-level geography. Alley explains particularly that the North Atlantic circulation pump is a powerful switch determining Earth's climate, namely, through the shutdown of the pump catalysed by Dansgaard-Oeschger events and Heinrich events. These events adversely alter climate dynamics by creating a drier climate in the Northern Hemisphere, disrupting monsoon circulation, expanding deserts, and shrinking tropical wetlands, thus reducing methane concentration in the atmosphere. Dansgaard-Oeschger events happen as a result of a warming climate, causing ice to melt and input large amounts of freshwater into the ocean. Heinrich events similarly produce the same consequence. This disrupts the delicate balance between saline and freshwater in the North Atlantic, which is necessary to operate the pump, effectively shutting down the North Atlantic circulation. With a warming climate and increased ice melting, I now question whether anthropogenic means can induce these events and what this means for our climate.\nWith climate change, I understand the importance of recognising the human aspects that enable this damage. Accordingly, I read \"This Changes Everything\" by Naomi Klein. This book offers a broad perspective on the long-standing conflict between humans and the environment, mixing geopolitics, science, economics and behavioural sciences. Klein emphasises how environmental injustices suffered by indigenous and marginalised communities expose societal flaws. She controversially frames geoengineering as a \"fix it later approach\", further prompting me to understand that science should not be a way to mask the failures of our current approaches to climate change as societies, or to mess with natural systems that we have yet to grasp fully, but rather as a way to demand substantial change. Ultimately, Klein inspires by challenging capitalist rules and redefining the climate crisis not just as a threat, but as a striking opportunity to confront our inherently flawed societies and rebuild them. This course intrigues me with the wealth of scientific knowledge it offers in its modules and its contribution to insightful and unique perspectives on tackling climate change. Studying this course marks the beginning of my involvement in the change I long for: driving our societies towards sustainable growth, developing solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change, and, most importantly, helping to reduce the number of \"losers\" in this climate challenge. This course distinctively offers me the chance to explore our relationship with Earth and how to improve this relationship, echoing the words of Ted Nield in \"Supercontinent\": \"Until we can live without her, Earth is not a part of our story - we are a part of hers.\".\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this subject?\nIn biology, I have learnt about the processes of photosynthesis and respiration and their importance in plants, especially. These processes have been further contextualised in geography through the study of case studies of the Amazon Rainforest and the Arctic Tundra, which emphasise the role of plants in the carbon cycle, one of Earth's life support systems. This further piqued my interest in understanding the role of plants in regulating the climate, leading me to read \"The Emerald Planet\" by David Beerling. Beerling illustrates the evolutionary journey of plants from the Palaeozoic era to the Cenozoic era. What stood out to me the most was Beerling's continual reinforcement of feedback processes throughout the book. He illustrates how, since the beginning of time, our climate has been powered by feedback responses. Although we cannot be certain precisely what feedback processes took place, we know how influential these processes are, from causing mass extinctions to providing a set of Goldilocks conditions for life. It is precisely the uncertainty of which way feedback processes could favour that is terrifying about anthropogenic climate change. However, Beerling does not end the book on that note; he reminds us that, from period to period, life has persisted through climatic changes. It does not eliminate the costs that climate change will demand from us, nor the need to address it, but at least it offers hope for humanity in the face of climate change.\n\nWhat have you done to prepare outside of education and why were these experiences useful?\nI have participated in two of Immerse Education's essay-based offers, an essay competition and an online research program. The essay I produced for the competition was titled \"Evaluating the Impact of Human Activity on the Earth's Geology\". I first examined the Anthropocene, discussing its definition and legitimacy as a formally recognised epoch. To demonstrate anthropogenic impacts, I highlighted mining as a cause of sinkholes, fracking-triggered earthquakes, and the presence of radioactive isotopes in isolated sinkhole lakes. My evaluation concluded that the lasting impact of human activity on Earth's geology remains heavily debatable and unclear. Furthermore, I understood that the examples I had researched were merely scratching the surface of such a multifaceted topic. I concluded that with continual technological advances, humans may soon be able to leave a lasting mark on geology that will endure through time. For my research program, I developed the title \"Is the UK on Track to Fulfil Its Climate Commitments Under the Paris Agreement? An Analysis of the UK's 2030 NDC and Carbon Budgets\" to focus on the human side of climate change, an area that challenges me. This topic proved demanding, but my findings were fruitful. I found that to meet the targeted emissions savings outlined in the Paris Agreement, there is a need to make electricity cheaper, specifically by making it cheaper than natural gas. This acts as an incentive for the adoption of low-carbon technologies, including heat pumps and electric cars. Furthermore, helping the UK address the necessary emissions savings in the energy supply, buildings and surface transport sectors. With one area experiencing a drop in emissions, a domino effect will ensue, triggering reductions in the other two areas. Cheaper electricity will support nationwide electrification, decarbonising the entirety of the UK.\nMy leadership in the Environmental Society at school has been immensely rewarding. A key highlight was delivering a talk on AI and climate change, where I discussed my findings on the carbon footprint of AI and its applications in combating climate change, including reforestation projects, recycling systems, and ocean cleanup. I was challenged by younger years, who posed questions like, \"If AI can be used to combat climate change, why has its use in this area still been so limited?\" Prompting me to reflect on my superficial understanding of AI. Before this speech, I failed to recognise that AI is not just generative; ChatGPT. Controversially, I concluded that, given the current generative AI boom, other forms of AI, such as those used to combat climate change, are not a priority area for investment. However, its future possibilities are vast, indicating a greater need for scientific knowledge to be applied in this sector. The study of Environmental science is crucial in this age of AI, for steering AI towards being a sword for climate justice rather than destruction.",

    "statement_full_text": "The potential relationship between childhood trauma and later violence - the idea of a 'downstream wreckage' - fascinates me, where initially I had assumed that adverse experiences in childhood e.g. repeated verbal or physical abuse from emotionally unpredictable and substance-dependant parents have always led to later interpersonal problems. However, by listening to the podcast of 'Does trauma cause violence?' by the Reith lectures, it has prompted me to question the extent to which this is a causal relationship. What intrigued me was the notion that within the same hostile and dysfunctional environment, siblings can have drastically different outcomes with one going on to potentially becoming a violent perpetrator and one leading a normal life. From this I began to reflect on the variability in human responses to stressors and how such differences play out in real life clinical settings, which naturally led me to explore the theme further in psychopathology – in particular the limitations of diagnostic criteria in relation to the DSM.\nThis curiosity prompted me on to read the book 'Madness Explained: Psychosis and Human Nature' by Richard P. Bentall, whose critique of traditional diagnostic systems such as the DSM compelled me to reflect on how, despite continued revisions throughout the years, they often neglect the interplay between individual histories and external circumstances. This led me to consider a key finding from the ECA study highlighted in the book, which found that over half of patients with a psychiatric disorder met criteria for at least one other disorder. This prompted me to question the assumption that mental disorders exist as discrete categories, and how such a rigid diagnostic approach ineffectively leads to treatments centred on the disorders rather than the person holistically.\nTo broaden my knowledge on the different perspectives of psychiatric diagnoses, I engaged with reading Rosenhan's study On Being Sane in Insane Places, and was particularly fascinated by its exploration on the boundaries of sanity and insanity. It enabled me to reflect on whether a specific environment i.e. a psychiatric hospital is crucial in determining how an individual is perceived to be sane or insane. The fact that the 'normal' behaviours were interpreted as manifestations of a certain disturbance merely due to a psychiatric setting redefined my view on how powerful labels are. Through Rosenhan's study, I came to recognise the lasting impacts of psychodiagnostics labels e.g. 'schizophrenic' 'insane' 'manic-depressive' at both personal and social levels ,which I found to be deeply unsettling. Such labels, whether accurate or not, can become permanently ingrained, which can depersonalise individuals and even turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, when I later watched Louis Theroux's documentary By Reason of Insanity, I realised that labels may not be… The documentary directed my attention towards the experiences of mentally ill patients within the legal system, and what stood out to me was that some mentally disordered offenders, detained for treatment in a psychiatric facility under NGRI, expressed preference for retaining the label of 'mentally ill' instead of facing standard procedures. This prompted me to reconsider how psychiatric labels can be both constraining and protective, depending on the individual's context and interpretation.\nReflecting on society broad perceptions of mental health sparked my curiosity in how the brain's specific functions shape behaviour at a structural level.Initially, I assumed that individuals in a vegetative state would be unresponsive to external cues. However after watching Adrian Owen's TEDTalk The Quest for Consciousness, I was struck by evidence from fMRIs showing that some patients retained conscious awareness and were able to perform deliberate actions in the premotor cortex. This made me realise how significant brain functions are in underpinning surface behaviour. Similarly, I found Nadine Burke Harris' talk interesting regarding how early adversity shapes brain development structurally and functionally, affecting areas such as the nucleus accumbens.\nI conducted an independent research project exploring the association between attachment types and conflict styles, which involved designing my own questionnaire and analysing large data sets – an experience that strengthened my research and analytical skills essential for studying psychology at university. As a maths mentor and literacy volunteer, I fostered positive learning environments collaboratively whilst developing leadership and communication skills. Being a psychology prefect allowed me to share my passion by organizing a lunchtime club. Furthermore, I am a Grade 8 pianist which reflects my dedication and discipline – qualities that will prove invaluable in research and clinical settings.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nI am driven by a conviction that rising conflict, inequality and polarisation around the world is drawing us towards Arendt's \"banality of evil\", and moreover that PPE is uniquely suited to help me challenge this.\nI concurred with Frankfurt's \"On Bullshit\", that a societal disregard for truth undermines both our discourse and economic agency. To expand on this, I participated in the NEULondon essay competition on the causes of political polarisation, arguing the perverse structural incentives of social media penalise integrity exemplified by the phenomenon of Frankfurtian bullshit in \"memes\" used as ironic rhetorical tools, for which I received a distinction. Applying Mill's \"free market of ideas\" framework, I ultimately concluded that the information landscape is skewed towards extreme viewpoints. However, I disagreed with Chomsky's view that economic elites collude to \"manufacture consent\", instead, I believe polarisation in our media is rising precisely because there is no centre of control.\nTo what extent does imperfect information cause war? Mostly, I decided, after encountering the concept of ESSs presented by Dawkins, drawing heavily from Game Theory, as a model for intrastate behaviour. I applied this framework to the Ukraine War, where, despite incurring costs by continuing to fight, bargaining frictions caused by imperfect information (as both sides' ability to fight is contingent on unpredictable factors such as foreign aid) elude solution. My view was challenged in \"Notes From the Underground\" where Dostoevsky attacks assumptions of human rationality, which led me to question the central assumptions of neoclassical economics and game theory. Could wars be caused by emotions, 'great men' or cultural history? Dostoevsky's view that over-rationalising our decisions dishonestly distances ourselves from our morality to me highlights the dangers of the \"banality of evil\" ever-present in our politics.\n\nHow have your qualifications or studies prepared you to study this subject?\nIn A-Level history, my teacher introduced me to the fascinating concept of \"Napoleon's dictum\", which argues that a person can be understood through the lens of the world when they were 20. I related this to notions of whether our wills can ever truly be \"free\" if they are so strongly influenced by the environment, a view I encountered from Robert Sapolsky on the 'Within Reason' podcast. In my interpretation of \"The Stranger\", the moral and psychological control society seeks to impose on Meursault through his trial struck me as another example of social determinism. Moreover, this has led me to question whether freedom is paradoxical in a determinist universe: non-random events must be determined, but neither collapsing into pure randomness nor pure determinism seem to bring about freedom.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and how have these experiences been useful?\nWhat is the best way to develop a poor country? I initially agreed with Acemoglu/Robinson's central thesis that inclusive institutions (such as those found in the settler-colonial structure of the US compared to quasi-feudal colonial México) are conducive to economic growth, which I found built of off Smith's initial observation that merchants and businessmen would try to rig markets in their favour. Building on this, I wrote in the student publication Etonomics and argued in \"Great Expectations and the Indian economy that never was\" that extractive institutions (such as the License Raj in India) are immoral because they perpetuated unequal economic control, exercised through elite networks and entrenched underdevelopment. Amartya Sen's humanist capabilities-led approach took a similar approach to criticising political and economic unfreedoms; I found his argument for redefining development in terms of substantive freedoms compelling.\nLeading my school's MUN and philosophy societies, I researched democratic backsliding around the world. Learning about crackdowns on judicial independence, the separation of powers and military coups in sub-Saharan Africa affirmed my belief in the intrinsic value of democracy. Choosing this as a tutorial topic during Balliol College's Floreat programme, I wrote an essay about the causes of democratisation and participated in a small-group discussion.",

    "statement_full_text": "Q1:\n\nMy decision to study natural sciences stems from a fascination with how biology, chemistry and physics intersect to explain fundamental questions. I delved into this by reading Tim Coulson's 'The Universal History of Us' in which he demonstrates the crucial need to understand these interactions, particularly in how life emerged from non-living matter through a series of chemical and physical processes.\n\nI have attended multiple Cambridge Natural Sciences taster days, where I found the course structure to be ideal as I wish to explore science broadly while eventually specialising. At one, we were given a talk on how to study evolution using the hydrostatics of blood flow. This demonstrated the flexibility of the course, allowing students to explore across the traditional subject boundaries. It also revealed to me the importance of a multidisciplinary scientific approach, particularly in research. Furthermore, reading about pioneering cellular treatments such as T cell editing in Mukherjee's 'The Song of the Cell' made me think of a career in pharmaceutical research. I would love to be involved at the cutting edge of new discoveries to have a positive impact, and it is clear that studying natural sciences offers the best foundation for this.\n\nQ2\n\nThrough both biological and physical sciences extension programmes, I have developed my research skills and explored new areas of science, such as biomaterials. I investigated bone-regenerating hydrogels, which led me to Wedlich's 'Slime: a Natural History'. Learning how the physical properties of hydrogels give them the remarkable ability to mimic the strength, flexibility and healing abilities of human skin made me appreciate how materials science and biology can combine in unexpected, innovative ways.\nMy problem-solving skills and understanding of core principles within science were developed by the Intermediate Biology Olympiad and Cambridge Chemistry Challenge. I achieved silver in both. I also took the initiative in forming a team for the Cambridge Biology Challenge, which developed critical thinking and collaborative skills by tackling complex problems such as 'does behaviour fossilize?'. In the two rounds we participated in, we won a distinction and highly commended.\n\nQ3\n\nReading Bowater's 'The Microbes Fight Back' showed me that industrial antibiotic leakage is a greater cause of antibiotic resistance than human misuse, highlighting the urgent need for global cooperation and communication. This inspired my research proposal, through St John's Oxford Inspire programme, on whether mRNA vaccines are the future of vaccination. Currently, due to their instability, mRNA vaccines require ultra-cold storage, severely limiting their global usage. I explored how recent innovations like lyophilisation and circular mRNA may overcome this instability and increase mRNA vaccine accessibility. The project gave me experience of engaging with academic research papers, providing exposure to university level study. I was awarded a research project award, which included a research skills day and a £100 book voucher.\n\nI spent a week shadowing scientists in the Raff Lab at the Dunn School of Pathology, learning how molecular biology experiments are carried out and analysed. I realised the persistence research demands and how techniques like fluorescent imaging rely on physics and chemistry. This built on earlier experience at the Biomedical Imaging Unit at Southampton General Hospital, where I observed advanced microscopy techniques in a healthcare setting. At the NHR Clinical Research Facility lab, I gained practical experience by independently processing a fake sample. I followed manuals and documentation, best practices and used equipment, developing time-management and lab skills essential in a demanding and scientific course like natural sciences.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nHow do formula one cars stay on track while maintaining speed in turns? What enables planes to fly? How to bring ideas to reality? I have always been passionate about problem thinking and questioned the 'why' and the 'how' of things. However, my vocation for engineering became apparent after watching the movie 'cars', which interested me in Formula One. Through this sport, I fueled my interest in the field of fluid dynamics which ultimately led me to discover mechanical engineering – where design meets physics to solve real life problems. Through this I understood that engineering is everything around us, contributing to building the world we live in today. Boats are able to move with just the sheer force of the wind on the sail and the keel, bridges are able to carry impressive weights and hold up with just a few pillars, even something as basic as a paper clip are created by engineers. Our future is partly in the hands of engineers, and I would like to be part of this world, working towards real life problems such as climate change.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nThrough the subjects I studied, more specifically the notion of resultant forces such as lift and the stability of an object if it has low centers of mass and a wide base area, I was able to understand part of the Formula One cars design when it came to aerodynamics. However, to fully grasp the concept I read the article ' Aerodynamics designs in Formula One cars' by Tianyu Li . I was particularly struck by the way the rear wing creates 20 % of the downforce. With the design of the airfoil slightly angled, the air passing underneath flows much faster than that on top. In addition, according to Bernoulli's effect and the equation P + ½ ρv^^2 = constant, the slower the velocity of the flow, the higher the pressure is. Thus, the air pressure exerted on the airfoil pushes the air upwards and an opposing force pushes the car downwards creating downforce. Gaining knowledge on the way the air moves around a car, I saw a link between racing cars and planes, which used the same principle only the other way round. This led me to watch the Ted ED 'Why do wings help you fly?', which actually corrected a misconception of mine, the air divided by the wing does not ensemble back together after. It is the deflection of the wing and the slower velocity of the flow underneath the surface that pushes the plane upwards and slightly backwards creating both drag and lift.\n\nPreparing for a French national logic Competition in which I finished in the top 1% , also helped me reinforce my critical and abstract thinking skills which are considered crucial qualities according to Guru Madhavan.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education,and why are these experiences useful?\n\nTo widen my knowledge of the engineering field, I read 'Think like an engineer' which outlines the engineering mind-set while designing a product. It claims that it is a 'modular systems thinking' where multiple techniques and principals mix to understand the flow of life. While visiting the Google labs center in Paris, I got to make links with the process described in the previous book, the way they made multiple prototypes and encouraged feedback to improve their projects and how they used different technologies in less developed countries to solve life-changing issues. Furthermore, experiencing work experience at Thales and IDEMIA - for which I followed the process of creation of a military surveillance radar as well as biometric systems of recognition used by the FBI, the Interpol and all main security systems -, I was struck by the importance of innovation. I was particularly fascinated by the constant change in products and small upgrades made on radars.This led me to read 'Where goods ideas come from: The natural history of innovation' by Steve Johnson. The author explains the concept of liquid networks, he claimed that innovations work like neurons, in a group where hunches and ideas can merge, all this balanced between chaos and order. This helps me understand the importance of group projects to which I look forward to participating in when I am studying at university.",
