    "statement_full_text": "My interest in psychology began when I was 11, during a difficult time in my life. My parents divorce happened suddenly, and I was later diagnosed with depression. Two years later, I fully recovered. This experience made me realise just how much psychology influences our everyday life and behaviour. Even though we all share similar genetics, I am fascinated by how and why people respond to situations so differently. I started questioning why do some people develop depression? How do others overcome it? Why do people behave the way they do? Psychology offered me a way to explore this through different approaches, for example social, cognitive, or biological. This furthered my passion to understand the human mind. I also study criminology, which has deepened my interest in human behaviour. I enjoy watching documentaries that explore criminal behaviour and mental health, as they give me real insight into how people think and act. I find all areas of psychology fascinating, and I am excited to explore them in greater depth. I believe that studying Psychology at university will help me develop the knowledge and professional experience needed for a future career in the field.\n\nThrough my studies, I have begun to understand how the human mind works and how to think scientifically. I have learned that there are different perspectives for explaining human behaviour, and rarely just one explanation. Whether from cognitive, behaviourist, or environmental approaches, it is important to compare and consider multiple explanations. I have studied influential psychological experiments, such as Zimbardo's (1973) Stanford Prison Experiment. My Criminology studies have deepened my understanding of why and how people commit crimes. It has shown me that criminality is not simply an individual matter but can be influenced by psychological, sociological, and environmental factors. This has encouraged me to see the world from the perspectives of victims, offenders, and also professionals from the criminal justice system, looking beyond labels and considering people's circumstances, motivations, and social inequalities. I am undertaking an Extended Project Qualification on \"What causes murder suspects in Hong Kong to change their statements in court?\" This research links closely to both psychology and criminology, as I will analyse how and why suspects might alter their statements. I will explore factors such as legal advice, emotional pressure, and new evidence, to understand the complexities behind these changes. This project will help me develop my research, essay writing, and presentation skills.\n\nPlaying piano I have learned to memorise complex pieces and replicate them precisely which has helped me develop discipline and concentration and memory skills. I now apply these skills when studying psychological theories and case studies. At 12, I moved to the UK to study at a private boarding school in Oswestry. This experience strengthened my independence and adaptability, as I had to manage my studies and daily life away from home. Living among students from different ethnic backgrounds improved my communication and organisational skills. I have participated in the UKMT Maths challenges earning bronze and silver certificates. This reflects my problem-solving and logical thinking skills, which are useful when evaluating psychological research or analysing behaviour. I volunteered at my school's Open Day, guiding students and their families around the school. This helped build my confidence and develop my communication and people skills. This will support my study of Psychology in areas like observation, interviewing, and interaction. In work experience at Little Sutton Nursery, I observed child development in a real-world setting. This helps me understand more about early attachment, social learning, and emotional behaviour. I am enthusiastic, curious, and committed to learning more about the human mind and I am ready to take the next step in my journey.",

    "statement_full_text": "The current conflicts which plague the world have fortified my interest in international politics, particularly the role of national identity in contributing to these tensions. Through researching the origins of the conflicts in Palestine and Kashmir, I understand that contradicting narratives of national identity are a fundamental cause of conflict. Reading Said's 'Orientalism' reinforced my belief, discussing the reasons behind why identity could be used as a discriminatory weapon. Said argues that a national identity is established by highlighting the differences in communities, thus fostering a harmful 'us versus them' mentality. In this case, I noticed national identity being used as a dividing force which perpetuates hostility, by supporting a belief that certain groups can be inherently superior to others. In search of a solution to this, I discovered that it was the same principle which could help unite nations and end conflicts. I examined the establishment of India's national identity post-1947, since it seemed to strike a successful balance between the preservation of the identities of smaller ethnic groups, and an overarching sense of togetherness.\nKhilnani's 'Idea of India' helped me understand the relevance of a national identity and how it drives political decision making. The identity of India was established through electoral freedom under a centralised state: participation in democracy was used as a symbol of belonging to the nation. Contrary to Said, I believe this proposes a viable solution to the issues we face today. I wish to study PPE to explore how we can effectively utilise the unifying power of national identity, to find a way to limit political conflict.\n\nTaking part in my school's Winter Reading Challenge, I was introduced to Singer's 'Famine, Affluence and Morality', where he uses the conflict in Bangladesh to explore the utilitarian duty to help those in suffering. This link between moral duty in the context of conflicts encouraged me to attend a lecture by Prof. Ypi at Cambridge titled 'Are Revolutions Justified?'. Ypi argues that revolutions can be justified when they aim to transform unjust political structures, and as moments of democratic re-foundation. Inspired by her, I then wrote a research project exploring the moral arguments around political revolutions. Whilst Nielsen's 'On Justifying Revolution' chose to take a solely utilitarian standpoint, it failed to recognise that it is wholly ineffective in situations where governments abuse their powers. So, revolutions should not only be justified in cases where there is a net benefit to society, as ultimately, when governments violate the rights they were created to protect, they forfeit their legitimacy. My study of politics A-Level helped me understand this, as the only way a government can truly be legitimate is by being held to account, and revolutions can be seen as the truest form of accountability.\n\nEnrolling in a Game Theory MOOC offered by Stanford introduced me to the concept of a Nash Equilibrium. I believe that the individual rationality of agents may lead to collective inefficiencies in large scale policy measures. The tendency of the Prisoners to defect shows the negative implications of this model, and can be effectively mapped onto real-world behaviours. This is evident in many climate change negotiations, where each country has an incentive to let the cost of reducing emissions fall on the backs of other nations. However, attending the Marshall Society Conference led me to challenge this view, through the lens of behavioural economics. I believe that the significance of reciprocity and altruism counters the idea of the collective inefficiencies, as can be seen in Fehr and Gächter's Public Goods Experiments. Thus, people abide by societal norms even at personal cost, despite its irrationality, as they care about the collective benefits it can bring to society. The interactions between different economic theories has strengthened my desire to pursue PPE, in order to further explore these concepts.",

    "statement_full_text": "Criminology appeals to me because it combines my fascination with law, justice and human behaviour. From the first moment I observed the careful reasoning of barristers at the Old Bailey, I was captivated by the power of the law to uncover truth and deliver justice. The complexity of human behaviour, the profound impact of crime on victims and society, and the challenge of understanding why people offend have inspired my desire to study criminology. Cases such as the Lucy Letby trial and contemporary debates surrounding youth crime, particularly highlighted in the Adolescence series, have shown me both the societal consequences of wrongdoing and the moral responsibility of those working within the justice system. My curiosity has driven me to explore the field beyond the classroom, including reading Criminology: A Sociological Introduction by Eamonn Carrabine, which has deepened my understanding of the relationship between crime, society, and ethics\n\nMy A level studies have provided me with a robust foundation for criminology, equipping me with both subject knowledge and transferable skills essential to the discipline. Psychology has fascinated me with its exploration of human behaviour and forensic methods, allowing me to understand how investigators reconstruct events and analyse motives. Studying topics such as criminal profiling and memory recall has sparked a desire to examine the psychological factors behind crime, from impulsivity to more complex patterns of behaviour. Biology has honed my scientific reasoning, precision, and analytical skills, enabling me to approach evidence methodically and critically -qualities vital when evaluating data, assessing case studies, or interpreting forensic results. Theology has challenged me to engage deeply with questions of morality, ethics, and responsibility, sharpening my ability to weigh complex arguments and consider multiple perspectives - a skill I know will be invaluable when evaluating legal and ethical issues within criminology. Across these subjects, I have developed a disciplined approach to research, an aptitude for synthesising information, and the capacity to construct evidence based, balanced conclusions. Together, they have not only prepared me academically but have also nurtured my curiosity and determination to understand the interplay between human behaviour, law, and justice.\n\nBeyond my academic studies, I have actively sought experiences that challenge me, develop my skills, and deepen my understanding of society and justice. As a NHVS leader, spending time with older members of the community has taught me patience, empathy, and the importance of attentive listening - qualities that I recognise as essential when engaging with victims, witnesses, or clients in a legal context. Mentoring younger students as a Willow rep, alongside serving as a senior prefect and vice house captain, has strengthened my leadership, communication, and organisational skills, while also reinforcing the importance of responsibility and reliability in positions of trust. My involvement in school productions has enhanced my confidence, adaptability, and public speaking abilities, preparing me to present arguments clearly and persuasively - an invaluable skill for courtroom advocacy. Playing football, hockey, and cricket has reinforced teamwork, strategic thinking, and resilience, all of which are vital when collaborating with colleagues in high pressure investigative or legal settings. Keeping up with current criminal justice debates, youth crime documentaries, and real world cases has sharpened my critical awareness of contemporary issues and motivated me to consider practical solutions to complex problems. Collectively, these experiences have not only equipped me with practical skills but have also nurtured a genuine passion for criminology, providing a strong foundation for further study and a future career dedicated to justice and societal impact.",

    "statement_full_text": "Returning to Sri Lanka, my family and friends voiced their past worries from the Boxing Day tsunami, how it destroyed fragile infrastructure that was 'resistant'. This led me to question the word 'resilience'. Engineers often associate this term with permanence and stability. Yet, I see it as adaptability. Moving between countries helped me develop a cross-cultural perspective – the architectural plans my mother made in Sri Lanka would be ineffective here. Depicted in my art from soft curves to harsh skylines, the contrast was highlighted. Sri Lankan roofs are flat for monsoon rain collection and shade relief, whilst the UK has pitched roofs adjusted to the changing weather. Seeing this, engineering demands a large criteria to be met, looking at the blend of cultural to environmental needs. Curious about how, I explored \"Biomimicry: Innovation inspired by Nature\" by Janine Benyus. It reveals that the best structures function biomimetically, using the environment as a blueprint. To deepen my understanding, I completed the ICE course on \"Shaping the Future\", where BedZED illustrated how flexibility in the environment and biomimicry can lead to sustainable cities and efficiency.\nWith the degree, I wish to work in structural engineering and create designs that not only endure external changes but thrive with it.\nMy studies sharpen my critical thinking skills, particularly through spotting patterns and drawing sensible conclusions. One key pattern is the importance of decision-making. From opportunity cost to cost-benefit analysis, I can objectively assess situations, and like engineers, minimise trade-offs. My judgement relies on statistics, linking probability to risk modelling, as seen in the redevelopment of the Millennium Bridge. The example prompted me to attend a lecture on structural dampening, introducing the concept that no structure is static and methods such as dampening and stiffening against gravitational and lateral loads. Learning physics independently taught that a slight change in the fragile equilibrium of the structure could lead to a cost. Strengthening my grasp on the balance of Newtonian mechanics, I tutor GCSE physics using examples and a logical chain of reasoning. I applied this when making the triangular truss model. Through modelling, I investigated the interaction of gravitational load capacity with compressive forces. I found the material and the ____ had mattered . This journey has enhanced my knowledge and made me reassess my views on changing conditions- that not only external influences matters, but internal factors too. The balance between this is essential.\nBeyond academics, I run a blog called 'Engineering across Borders', documenting and presenting my journey through modern case studies, literature reviews and my art lens. Alongside this, I initiated a project on 'Multi-Dimensional Sustainability', investigating its relation to sustainability and level of income. The results confirmed the hypothesis- higher income countries are better in sustainability socioeconomically but not environmentally. Assisted by my skills in videography, journalism and posts using AutoCAD, through trial and error, I began translating results visually, into graphs. Also using this in remodelling a Sri Lankan house, demonstrating how termite mounds can improve ventilation. This developed discipline and creativity, and my mother, an architect, helped innovate. Noticing the value of teamwork and communication, I did a Zooniverse citizen project. It pushed me to collaborate with and contribute data to researchers. Seeing how researchers were able to convey technical topics simply, I wanted to strengthen my articulation. It led me to teaching GCSE Mandarin and assisting in a primary school. Applying these skills to build exposure and confidence in real-world settings, helped construct a sense of responsibility. Expanding this through applications such as volunteering at an Oxfam shop, networking, competitions, further built my abilities, allowing me to thrive.\nRe-evaluating my initial belief, I learnt that adaptability isn't only necessary in infrastructure, but in engineers as well. I believe that the course will enable me to refine these skills to adapt to the complexities and challenges faced.",
