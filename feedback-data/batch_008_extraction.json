    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course?\n\nMy desire to study the combination of history and economics stemmed from my mother teaching me about Japanese colonialism in Korea. What intrigued me most was how Japanese imperialism created contested legacies over East Asia that still shape political tensions today.?\nThis curiosity deepened after Dr. Kim's lecture on Japanese colonial rule, which showed how policies like Japanese-language schooling and the land survey programme subverted everyday life, standardizing ownership as well as allowing extraction. What struck me was how these measures were not just administrative but transformative, altering education, property rights and cultural identity.\nI explored the economic aspect further through Betty L. King's article which analyzed Japan's investment in infrastructure, particularly railways, as both a tool of economic control and driver of modernization. I was fascinated by this ambiguity: did colonialism lay foundations for Korea's later development, or impose obstacles that Koreans had to overcome? Studwell's 'How Asia Works' helped me view the question more comparatively. His analysis of land reform and state industrialization as responsible for East Asia's growth suggested that Korea's post-liberation success was more due to its own policies than colonial structures. Comparing this with the Philippines, which lacked such reforms, led me to conclude that Japanese rule imposed as many obstacles as it left institutions, and that Korea's later growth was achieved despite, not because of, colonialism.\nWhat fascinates me most is how these contested legacies remain central to international relations today, with historical memory shaping political debates between Japan and Korea.?\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course?\nStudying the French Revolution at A-Level drew me to how liberal and nationalist ideas spread across Europe which I developed further in the Julia Wood Essay Competition where I evaluated the significance of the 1848 Revolutions. While A.J.P. Taylor rejected them as 'the turning point at which history failed to turn', I argued that their significance lay in reshaping political culture. Despite their immediate failure, I learnt from Christopher Clark's lecture that the revolutions embedded ideas of popular mobilization and reframed political debates. I found this idea more compelling as it better accounts for how temporary liberal spaces in Prussia allowed nationalist and liberal ideas to circulate more freely, creating networks and political culture that contributed to Germany's unification. Reflecting on this taught me to look beyond immediate outcomes and focus on long-term impacts.\nThat same approach shaped my engagement in economics. I was intrigued by the question of how beneficial privatization and liberalization truly was to efficiency and growth, leading to an interest in their real-world consequences in the 'transition recession' of the 1990s. I first engaged with this in the Rybczynski Prize where I concluded that the depth of the recession was not an unavoidable feature of post-communist liberalization but a result of policy design. Aslund argued that rapid reforms were necessary to stabilize currencies and avoid worse collapse, shown by Poland's quick recovery. However, I found Stiglitz's critique that shock therapy deepened contraction in 'Globalisation and its Discontents' more convincing as it explained why many states like Russia and Ukraine's GDP took almost ten years to recover. Seeing how GDP collapse, hyperinflation and rising poverty undermined trust in new institutions convinced me that rushing reforms without safeguards led to avoidable consequences.\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside education and why are these experiences useful?\nIn school, I have roles as a Finance Society lead where I have run sessions on the history of financial crises, as well as a maths mentor and careers committee member. A large part of my life also involves volunteering shown by last summer, when I spent time with the child refugees at St Mary's Ukrainian School which introduced me to traditional meals, culture and history.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course?\n\nI am fascinated by how institutions shape societies, whether through colonial legacies, revolutionary upheavals or economic transitions. My interest began with the impact of Japanese imperialism in Korea. Betty L. King's article showed how railways and banks, appearing to modernize, were in fact tools of extraction that restricted Korean enterprise. This led me to the deeply contested debate over whether colonialism laid the foundations for Korea's growth or created obstacles to overcome.\nMichael Kim's lecture on Japanese occupation gave me a more concrete answer by examining everyday policies. Japanese-language schooling erased Korean language and undermined cultural continuity. Access to higher education was barred, leaving Korea in 1945 with few trained professionals which hindered growth.\nThe land survey programme dispossessed farmers without documents, raising tenancy rates above 70% by the 1930s. High rents discouraged tenants from investing in productivity and embedded rural inequality. This suppressed domestic demand and diverted capital to Japan.\nOnly after 1945, with land reform and the re-Koreanisation of education, did South Korea build the foundations of later growth. These examples convinced me that institutions, not colonial policies, underpinned later growth.\nI want to study History and Economics to understand how institutions shape lives, and why people can view the same past so differently.\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course?\nThe French Revolution first drew me to how revolutionary ideas spread across Europe which I explored by evaluating the significance of the 1848 Revolutions. A.J.P. Taylor's view that 1848 was a 'turning point at which history failed to turn' was persuasive as monarchies survived and most uprisings failed, until Christopher Clark's lecture and Revolutionary Spring shifted my perspective. He argued that even failed uprisings reshaped political culture by forcing regimes to confront demands for constitutions, rights and national self-determination. Once the ideas were voiced, they could not be erased.\nThe Frankfurt Parliament demonstrated this. Though its Constitution was rejected, the debates over monarchy, federalism and rights created a model later used in German unification. Similarly in Italy, Piedmont's Statuo Albertino survived after defeat, keeping it a constitutional monarchy while others reverted to absolutism. These cases taught me to look beyond immediate collapse to long-term institutional shifts.\nI applied the same approach to economics. After communism collapsed, recessions in Eastern Europe were often seen as unavoidable while others argued the severity could have been mitigated through policy design. Stiglitz's Globalisation and Its Discontents showed that the depth of collapse in the 1990s depended on policy sequencing and institutions.\nIn Russia, shock therapy liberalized prices and privatized firms before regulatory frameworks existed. GDP fell by 40%, unemployment soared and oligarchs seized state assets, leading to a later recovery reliant on oil and gas rather than effective structures. Poland also liberalized rapidly under the Balcerowicz Plan but under stronger institutions, an independent central bank and integration with EU markets. GDP fell in 1990-91 yet growth resumed by 1992, making Poland the first post-communist economy to recover.\nComparing these paths convinced me that transition outcomes were not inevitable. Both states liberalized quickly but weak institutions and poor sequencing created Russia's 'lost decade' while Poland's institutional strength enabled stability and growth. I realized political choices determine whether reforms succeed or deepen crisis.\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside education and why are these experiences useful?\nIn school, I have roles as a Finance Society lead where I have run sessions on the history of financial crises, as well as a maths mentor and careers committee member. A large part of my life also involves volunteering; last summer, when I spent time with the refugees at St Mary's Ukrainian School, I was introduced to traditional meals, culture and history.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course?\n\nMy interest in the relationship between institutions and development was piqued when I read about the impact of Japanese imperialism on Korea's economy. A Betty L. King article showed me that railways and banks, which appeared to modernize Korea, were in fact tools of extraction that restricted Korean enterprise. This led me to the deeply contested debate over whether colonialism ultimately supported Korea by laying the foundations for growth or created more obstacles. Eckert's Offspring of Empire and his studies on colonial industry claim that while politically oppressive, imperialism was the catalyst for Korea's growth which showed me how contested the issue is.\nMichael Kim's lecture on Japanese occupation suggested that everyday policies like Japanese-language schooling reduced Korean literacy and limited access to higher education; by 1945, Koreans held fewer than 5% of skilled professional positions, leaving the country without the doctors, engineers or administrators needed to drive development. The land survey programme transferred land from farmers with no documented ownership to Japanese firms, pushing tenancy rates to 70% by the 1930s. High rents discouraged tenants from productive investment and entrenched rural inequality. Much of the rice surplus was exported to Japan, limiting domestic consumption and ensuring rural profits served Japanese rather than Korean markets.\nAfter 1945, reforms reversed these patterns. Land redistribution created a class or smallholders who invested in productivity and the re-Koreanisation of education expanded access to skilled jobs. These policies strengthened equity and human capital, laying the institutional foundations for rapid growth. This showed me that it was the transformation of institutions after independence, rather than colonial policies that underpinned Korea's growth.\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course?\nThe French Revolution first drew me to how revolutionary ideas spread across Europe which I explored by evaluating the significance of the 1848 Revolutions. A.J.P. Taylor's view that 1848 was a 'turning point at which history failed to turn' was persuasive as monarchies survived and most uprisings failed, until Christopher Clark's lecture and Revolutionary Spring shifted my perspective. He argued that even failed uprisings reshaped political culture by forcing regimes to confront demands for constitutions, rights and national self-determination. Once the ideas were voiced, they could not be erased.\nThe Frankfurt Parliament demonstrated this. Though its Constitution was rejected, the debates over monarchy, federalism and rights created a model later used in German unification. Similarly in Italy, Piedmont's Statuo Albertino survived after defeat, keeping it a constitutional monarchy while others reverted to absolutism. These cases taught me to look beyond immediate collapse to long-term institutional shifts.\nI applied the same approach to economics. After communism collapsed, recessions in Eastern Europe were often seen as unavoidable while others argued the severity could have been mitigated through policy design. Stiglitz's Globalisation and Its Discontents showed that the depth of collapse in the 1990s depended on policy sequencing and institutions.\nIn Russia, shock therapy liberalized prices and privatized firms before regulatory frameworks existed. GDP fell by 40%, unemployment soared and oligarchs seized state assets, leading to a later recovery reliant on oil and gas rather than effective structures. Poland also liberalized rapidly under the Balcerowicz Plan but under stronger institutions, an independent central bank and integration with EU markets. GDP fell in 1990-91 yet growth resumed by 1992, making Poland the first post-communist economy to recover.\nComparing these paths convinced me that transition outcomes were not inevitable. Both states liberalized quickly but weak institutions and poor sequencing created Russia's 'lost decade' while Poland's institutional strength enabled stability and growth. I realized political choices determine whether reforms succeed or deepen crisis.\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside education and why are these experiences useful?\nIn school, I have roles as a Finance Society lead where I have run sessions on the history of financial crises, as well as a maths mentor and careers committee member. A large part of my life also involves volunteering; working with Ukrainian refugees reminded me that institutional resilience is not only a historical question but a pressing issue in today's crises.",

A crucial point in the midst of the post-war global political climate, the Vietnam War  causations and consequences but also its wider scope and how it relates further to our past and present.  encapsulate what the twentieth century was all about; battles of ideology, proxy wars, and imperialism disguised as defending a feigned 'honour'.  not just the military or political history of the conflict, but also how it forces us to confront contested narratives about morality and responsibility. This war was the climax point of a century of ideological war that was rooted in colonialism, which dates back to as far as the mid-nineteenth century, the French conquest of Dai Nam. The fact that our actions in the present can result in turmoil more than a century later is what allows the study of history to remain so pertinent today. This interest in the Vietnam War led me to my EPQ, titled, To what extent did the Vietnam War reshape American society, politics, and national psychology?. I examined various academic journals, and books such as The Cold War and Vietnam by George C. Herring, American Studies in Vietnam: Past and Present by Le Thi Thu Hang, which discuss how Vietnamese studies were altered after the war, how Vietnam has been shaped as a country since the war's end, and how American Studies have been cemented in Vietnam, displaying the ramifications our history has on the present motivates me to delve into the subject further at university.\n\nwhether America was most to blame for the Cold WarI looked more into the history of Cuba pre-1959 and completed an independent research project on the exploitation and manipulation of the US in Cuba. Discovering how events intersect with societal aspects of life further ignited my passion for History. I then attended a lecture at SOAS University by Dr. Andreas Krieg on the Gaza War, which further delved into the societal aspects of these conflicts and how they can, intentionally or not, have  society and people. This angle of History was further explored in my A-Level coursework studying Russia from 1855-1964, prompting me to attend a lecture by Historian Christopher Read on Lenin \n\nOver the course of Year 12, I participated in the Mayor of London Future Leaders scheme. This enriching course empowered me to advocate for equality and diversity, and stand against hate and intolerance. It also honed my analytical and research skills, as I explored case studies of social and political change, the causes and effects of policy decisions, and how leadership shapes societies. Undertaking work experience at the Health Policy Partnership and speaking to various members of the team provided a real insight into working life. I spoke to people individually and got first-hand experience on how to conduct high-quality analysis and research of academic literature. Additionally, I learnt about parts of medicine and health policy that evolved over time, and the historical paradigm shifts about the understanding of health policy a lecture by Dr. Cassandra Quave at Emory University Paradigm Shifts in the History of Medicine I learnt more about germ theory, the works of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, and how Koch's postulates became cemented in our history.",

    "statement_full_text": "KCL LSE UCL Warwick \n\n1. Why do you want to study this course or subject? \n\nMy  interest  in  law  was  inspired  by  Professor  Daniella  Lock's  seminar  on  protest  law, \nprovided  by  King's  College  London's  K+  programme.  Exposed  to  areas  of  public  and \ncriminal  law,  I  created  an  academic  poster  on  the  impacts  of  protest  law  in  the  UK   and \ndelivered  a  presentation  to  spread  awareness  on  how  liberty  was  declining  due  to \nparliamentary  sovereignty.  I  understood  that   International  agreements  like  the  European \nConvention  on  Human  Rights (ECHR), embodied the values of a civil society by protecting \nthe  freedom  for  assembly  and  expression.  However  legislation  passed by parliament such \nas  the  Police,  Crime,  Sentencing  and  Court  Act  2022  limited  citizens  rights  as  law \nenforcement widened their criteria for restricting protests. Originally protests were restricted \nin order to prevent \"disorder, damage and disruption\". With the new law, \"impact\" was added \nto  the  criteria.  This  change  arguably  promoted  unfair  and  exploitative  practices  by  law \nenforcement as the right to descent could be silenced by the interpretations of individuals. In \nreading  Michael  Head's  book  \"Democracy,  Protest  and  the  Law:  Defending  a  democratic \nright\",  the  notion  of  the  right  to  protest  being  an  indispensable  safeguard  for  democracy \nresonated within me. Nevertheless, was this \"safeguard\" truly effective? and could we refine \nthe  legal  system  by  allowing  the  supreme  court  to  veto  bills incompatible with the ECHR?  \nThese opinions drew me closer to the study of law as I found myself forced to find solutions \nto issues impacting society. \n\nQuestion 2: \n\nStudying political events such as the Rwanda Bill furthered my interest in public law. \nAlthough the Rwanda Bill violated Article 3 of the ECHR, the Supreme Court was unable to \nblock the Bill from being passed. To me, this event was indicative of a legal system that \ndisregards the authority of an uncodified constitution. A.V. Dicey's description of \nparliamentary sovereignty explained how and why Parliament was commanding of \nlegislation. The legal system, therefore, continues to enable governments in dismantling \nhuman rights, as laws are unentrenched. Nevertheless, I saw the merits of an uncodified \nconstitution, as it facilitates the adaptation of laws in accordance with the evolution of \nsociety. My curiosity led me to watch the Oxford Union debate, \"Should We Codify the British \nConstitution?\" Sir Robert Buckland argued on whether it was necessary to change our \norganic constitution, as well as the impossibility of crafting laws without loopholes. I \nunderstood his perspective, but I did not see the impossibility of a perfect legal system as a \nreason to avoid revamping the constitution. Conversely, Professor Randy Barnett argued \nthat a codified constitution fulfilled what contract theorists called the \"deliberate function\". \nReflecting on my research, I saw a codified constitution not only as a deterrent to dictatorial \nrule but also as a way of empowering citizens through convenient access to the law. At \nuniversity I hope to learn about how the Supreme Court's abilities are limited due to its \npower being bestowed by parliament. \n\n \nQ3: \n\nMy internship at the corporate law firm Macfarlanes made me keen to understand how the \nprinciples of law are upheld across different disciplines. I saw the landmark ruling Uber BV v \nAslam as a means of maintaining worker rights in receiving a minimum wage. The \nimplications this had on gig economy businesses could be seen through  increased \noperational costs. My internship taught me the importance of firms acting in the spirit of the \nlaw and not just following  profit chasing sentiments. However legal loopholes mean firms \ncan reclassify job roles in order to restructure contracts, therefore keeping profits. \nFurthermore  lobbying poses the question of whether it is ethically right for laws which are \nmeant to uphold justice to  simply be bought. I believe Reform is on the horizon and in \nstudying law I can further question our legal system and take steps towards limiting \nbureaucratic reach in society.",
