    "statement_full_text": "Studying Psychopathology within A-Level Psychology introduced me to the cognitive and biological explanations for mental disorders. My interest in the topic made me question how and when differences in brain structure manifest into differences in behaviour. I was fortunate enough to attend a Neuroscience lecture at King's College London where studies conducted on mice recorded their behaviour and structural abnormalities in their brains. The results of the studies showed that despite these structural differences being present soon after birth, they would not be expressed in behaviour until midlife. The lecture introduced me to the typical indicators of psychological abnormality ,such as loss of inhibition. Understanding that the human brain is infinitely more complex than that of a mouse's meant I had questioned what other traits determined psychological abnormality in a person. This led me to learn more about standard diagnostic procedures for mental illness to explore non-biological indicators. Reading about Rosenhan's study, 'On being sane in an insane place', showed me the previous shortcomings of psychiatric diagnosis due to experts being unfamiliar with the firsthand experience of mental illness. Learning that these faults commonly lead to misdiagnosis showed me the importance of accurately defining mental illness. I explored this theme further in my EPQ project, titled 'How is idealisation of tragedy in younger generations impacting mental health treatments?', where I discussed how symptoms of mental illness can be perceived within different environments and the effect on how successful treatment can be in response.",

    "statement_full_text": "Reading an article on the use of convolutional neural networks in pancreatic cancer detection, I was intrigued by the real-world application of computer science, sparking my interest in the subject. The impact of such technologies resonates with me, proving crucial in the understaffed and outdated healthcare in my home country, Bangladesh. Curious about how such models worked, I read 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow, which introduced me to key ML concepts. I learned how CNNS use a hierarchy of layers, each detecting a pattern. A cross-entropy loss is calculated, and a backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradients, which are corrected by gradient descent to give an accurate prediction. I was fascinated how such abstract ideas can be transformed to solve practical problems and help save lives, further motivating me to study computer science.\n\nI was introduced to cybersecurity through my work experience at JPMorgan, where I was lectured on hash functions. I was intrigued by the way algorithms were used to create an irreversible and deterministic output using maths. The importance of these in data privacy and password protection was apparent to me, and I therefore built my own hashing simulator, which uses both MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms. I implemented an avalanche effect visualiser,calculating an average 95.6% difference in the hashes by changing 1 letter. Curious about the differences between, the two algorithms, I benchmarked the performances by measuring the clock time, leading me to conclude that MD5 is faster, but less secure due to being 128 bit as opposed to 160. This project made me realise how cybersecurity needs a balance of efficiency and robustness, and how seemingly small encryption choices can have large security impacts, which I want to explore in my studies.\n\nFollowing this, I wanted to further explore encryption and cryptography, leading me to read 'Decipher: The Greatest Codes and How to Break Them', where I was drawn to techniques such as frequency analysis and paillier encryption, which I used to code a secure voting system. Each vote is tallied while encrypted and can only be decrypted using the private key. However, the O(n) time complexity made it impractical in large elections. Hence, I implemented parallel encryption and incremental tallying to increase efficiency. This strengthened my ability to turn theory into a practical system, as well as improve my design based on potential limitations.\n\nTo practice my Python, I completed challenges from the CSES problem set. Due to my interest in maths, I particularly enjoyed the task of finding the Fibonacci number for modulo 10^9 + 7. This was a challenge as a simple recursive approach was not suitable due to the large computation needed. Instead, I coded matrix multiplication and exponentiation for the calculation, passing all test cases in O(logn) time. I also developed my problem-solving by achieving gold awards in the UKMT challenges and the BEBRAS challenge, as well as a highly commended in the Ritangle competition.\n\nThrough my UNIQ maths summer school at Oxford University, I learned about markov chains and eigenvectors, and was given a demo where this was used to make a chatbot, inspiring me to program a rugby phase outcome predictor. I built a webscraper using BeautifulSoup to gather rugby phase data, then computed the probabilities of each transition, and formed a transition matrix using Numpy. To aid my understanding, I created a markov chain visualiser using networkX, creating a diagram of the probabilities represented as nodes. This project increased my proficiency in working with libraries and made me recognise the importance of maths in computer science.\n\nIn addition, I am a starter on the school rugby 1st XV. I have interned twice, where I developed a product at a biotech startup, showing my discipline and communication skills. As an aspiring computer scientist, I hope to be able to use my studies to address and solve many real-world problems.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nMy interest in law originally grew from reading fiction. For example, 'The Kite Runner' made me confront the abuse people suffer under oppressive regimes, particularly children. I drew parallels from the story to real world scenarios like the ongoing oppression by the Taliban and suffering of Palestinians. This prompted me to look into how international and constitutional law protects people, making me realise it has limitations in being fully successful in application.\n\nTo further explore different areas of law, I read Catherine Barnard's 'What About Law?' Previously seeing the law as simply a set of rules, the unique story of each case made me see it as an essential part of people's everyday lives. It also allowed me to see the fluidity of law as often being informed by subjectivity and emotion but ultimately structured by principle and consistency.\n\nWhile reading other fictional texts, I began to constantly think about how the law played an indirect yet fundamental role in the storylines. My literary curiosity has therefore developed into a commitment to studying law itself, so I can further explore how rights are created, limited, and protected.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nWhile studying Spanish, I wrote a speech about the mass incarceration and military crackdown on gangs in Ecuador. In doing so, I researched different approaches to retribution and rehabilitation. The scale and extremity of Ecuador's situation contradicted my values around rehabilitating offenders and the protection of their dignity. In trying to outline a possible solution, I was challenged to balance the preservation of rights and the protection of public safety.\n\nTo learn more, I took a course on FutureLearn called 'Incarceration: Are Prisons a Suitable Punishment?' This opened my mind to not only think about incarceration punitively, but also from an economic, ethical and utilitarian perspective.\n\nAs a result, I began to engage more deeply when reading about migrants being detained in the news. I was curious about the laws and rights involved for different types of migrants, so I took a course called 'Law and the Framing of Migrants and Migration.'\n\nThrough this, I explored how anti-migration sentiment in the US and UK has influenced legal decision making and often led to the mistreatment of vulnerable groups. It revealed how even Western democracies have flaws in the protection of fundamental rights, similar to those I had previously recognised in oppressive regimes.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nOutside of my formal education, I participated in a debating competition where my team came first in our region. In having to defend positions I did not initially agree with, I learnt to anticipate counterarguments and explore views that may not be intuitive to me, skills essential to legal reasoning. To further challenge my communicative skills, I participated in the Auckland Spanish Debating Competition which forced me to become more deliberate in my use of words, translating into law which requires close attention to vocabulary and phrasing.\n\nAdditionally, legal mooting allowed me to apply my analytical and communicative skills to a legal context. This helped me to become familiar with certain legal jargon and terminology. It also honed my abilities to closely read and process dense amounts of information and detail, especially that which may be misleading.\n\nTo engage more with areas of law I was interested in, I read 'The Challenges of Democracy and the Rule of Law' in which Jonathan Sumption argued that Covid lockdown laws infringed on the right to movement and quality of life. I disagreed with the notion of this outweighing the risks to public health as the violation was minimal, with significant social benefits. I saw a link between this and the situation in Ecuador, comparing the complexities of the situations and recognising the subjectivity around the degree of control the law should have.",

    "statement_full_text": "The story of Mansa Musa, a ruler draped in gold, whose pilgrimage would weave chaos into Egypt's economy was what sparked my curiosity into the interplay between history, society, and economy. As he generously scattered his wealth in all of Cairo, his actions ultimately caused the value of gold to crumble, illustrating the paradox of plenty. Analysing this, I realised that it is the absence in societal structures - as much as the abundance - that moulds the world. Mansa Musa's economic disruption also highlighted political dynamics of wealth and authority. The philosophical questions raised by his actions also emphasized the ethical responsibilities of the people holding power in shaping equitable societies. To discern between correlation and causation, I found that my intellectual curiosity ventures into the realms of politics, philosophy, and economics (PPE).\n\nDelving into relevant literature On Politics by Alan Ryan, I was particularly drawn to John Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice,\" which introduced me to the concept of \"veil of ignorance\" and principle of benefiting the least advantaged, which led me to question how these theories apply in diverse global contexts like United Nations' attempt for socially just laws, globally. However, Rawl's abstract theory fails in societies like those I was brought up in - rigid with ethno-religious and class distinctions - where justice is more complex than pure impartiality. This exploration prompted me to engage with other philosophical perspectives, like utilitarianism.\n\nWith a mind which thrived on analysis of complex mathematical problems through my study of mechanics, algorithms, and quantitative economics, my experiences cultivated a precision and clarity about different philosophical issues.\n\nAs the founder of Aaj ka Qadam, an NGO focused on bonded labour, I was motivated to eliminate inequality and unfairness that persists in our society. Fieldwork like working towards labor laws and conducting interviews with brick kiln workers for my research paper exposed me to the harsh realities of exploitation and social injustice. This developed me as a researcher and assisted me to overcome preconceptions and navigate complex ethical situations - a skill vital in philosophical discourse. Moreover, it introduced me to the challenges of implementing social policies, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application.\n\nMy journey of empowering others led me to 'The Debate Room': an initiative where I led a team of talented but underprivileged teenagers as I taught them the intricacies of debate, critical thinking, and self-confidence. Using the Socratic method \"elenchus,\" I enabled students to think from different perspectives and reach conclusions. This experience honed my leadership skills and strengthened my belief in the transformative power of education. I wanted to inspire young minds to develop a will to change the world by discovering their own voices, much like Bulleh Shah's poetry, 'Bulleh, I know not who I am,' helped me find mine. My love for reading and writing poetry has shaped my way of thinking, allowing me to view the world through layers of meaning and question the structures that define our society.\n\nAdditionally, coming 3rd in Pakistan Young Finance Economics Tournament, bagging a Gold in Cup-Ex in Batumi, Georgia, and earning a Higher Distinction at the World Economics Cup (WEC) - where I analysed research papers and quantitative data, found trends, and wrote essays - boosted my confidence as I applied my abilities, like regression analysis, and intellect to the test. endeavours.\n\nThe UK, with its global relevance and historical importance, serves as the perfect stage for my higher education endeavours. The multifaceted and interdisciplinary nature of the PPE course is what ultimately draws me to explore how to nurture a comprehensive perspective which will be essential for addressing justice, equality, and social progress in our interconnected world.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nMy curiosity began while interviewing bonded labourers who worked long hours for little pay. I was struck that exploitation survived through consent. People accepted inequality as order. I realised that injustice is enforced by power and sustained by belief. I want to learn how systems gain acceptance, how real change happens, and how to rebuild institutions that serve people rather than control them. Politics, Philosophy, and Economics will enable me to study power, ideas, and policy harmoniously to satiate my curiosity.\n\nQuestion 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nDuring the interviews, I was struck by how many gave consent to their own exploitation. A Heywood's Politics helped me frame the question: can authority rest on forced consent? That question led me back to Pakistan.\nGramsci's concept of hegemony exhibited that culture and institutions can manufacture consent and normalize domination. Asim S Akhtar's Politics of Common Sense built on that by shedding light on how rulers embed inequality in daily life that it feels inescapable. This understanding allowed me to view Pakistanis as these bonded labourers: same consent towards own exclusion. \nDomination here is not just false consciousness. It is the product of a weak capitalist order in which the bourgeoisie itself depends on the state. Patriarchy recasts obedience as duty at home; military recasts interventions in politics as guardianship. Both normalise domination as protection.\nPeople don't obey because they agree; they obey as resistance feels futile. That makes the state strong on control and weak on care - reaching this paradox of Pakistan being an over- and underdeveloped state. This contradiction is as much related to economic incentives as it is political. To explore that tangent, I wrote a research paper on GDP per capita and electricity access. Upon analysis, the underlying structures revealed that relationship was correlational rather than causal. Access matched colonial divisions, not growth. It proved that our system came from a state built to extract, not to improve lives. For me, the lesson is clear: economics cannot be separated from politics. It is evident in Lahore where inequality kills trust and why it matters.\nThis led me to my love for poetry and Bulleh Shah. His poetry taught me to reject the distinctions our culture naturalises - caste, class, and status - and to seek the divine in everyday equality. Bulleh Shah remind us that without equality, neither faith nor society can hold.\nThat insistence on trust and equality made me rethink belief itself. A LUMS talk on Pascal's Wager left me with a question: can you try to believe in God? My answer was no. You cannot try and believe at the same time. Belief depends on effort, but effort itself breaks belief. It is a paradox that mirrors how conviction often grows from uncertainty.\n\nQuestion 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nMy journey of empowering others led me to The Debate Room: an initiative where I taught a team of talented but underprivileged teenagers the intricacies of debate and critical thinking using the Socratic method elenchus. This experience honed my leadership skills and strengthened my belief in the transformative power of education. \nAdditionally, coming 3rd in PYFET, bagging a Gold in Cup-Ex in Georgia, and earning a Higher Distinction at the World Economics Cup - where I analysed research papers and quantitative data, found trends, and wrote essays – enabled me to effectively use data, graphs, and models like regression analysis: essential skills for policy evaluation. \nAs the founder of Aaj ka Qadam, an NGO focused on bonded labour, I was motivated to eliminate inequality and unfairness that persist in our society. Working for better labour laws, the fieldwork for my research paper turned theory into practice: ideas about justice and reform met the realities of data, policy, and people. This developed me as a researcher and helped me overcome preconceptions, strengthening my ability to navigate complex ethical situations - skills vital for both philosophy and policy research.",
