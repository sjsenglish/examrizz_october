    "statement_full_text": "Personal Statement\n\nI am enamoured with the idea that we can interact with the world on a molecular level, a scale so small and intangible and yet still known to us. My interest stems from this curiosity, where it developed into an appreciation for physical chemistry, a desire to observe molecules and their behaviours. What really captivates me is a relatively modern form of chemistry; A field first developed as Heitler and London put pen to paper, utilising Schrodinger's equation to map out the interaction between two hydrogen atoms. The history of quantum chemistry alone is inspiring. Shaped by the collaboration of countless physicists and chemists, it truly encapsulates the scientific world, but its applications are even more impressive. From predicting material properties to modelling drug activity in the body, quantum chemistry is a tool for understanding. It's a framework that allows us to decode the interactions between molecules and truly demonstrates the scope of chemistry; Because chemistry isn't just as small as a molecule you study, it's vast and elusive, and we can only hope to keep expanding the boundaries of what we know, which I know I will spend my life achieving.\n\nI've been engrossed by bonding and the interactions between molecules, learning the behaviours of molecules and what causes them. Learning about particle interactions encouraged me to consider the importance of quantum mechanics in chemistry. These concepts inspired me to get involved with my subjects further, which is why I undertook the STEM SMART programme. This gave me the opportunity to explore chemistry at a greater depth through intricate problems that extend beyond the A-level. Having complex oxidation state problems explained by established academics gave me insight into how to develop my thinking to comprehend new ideas, establishing a more critical approach to learning like an academic should. Learning about electron configuration this year had me wondering if anything else I learned had been simplified to make it digestible, leading me to research more advanced concepts independently. I read articles about the attainment of a single electron covalent bond, which completely changed my perception on the limits of what we consider fact. I was surprised that Pauling theorised a covalent bond with just one electron nearly 100 years ago, but the fact that it was recently achieved is what really stunned me. This introduced me to the thrill of being proven wrong, reminding me that chemistry is not about studying facts, but challenging them in the pursuit of truth and understanding.\n\nI participated in the Lucy Cavendish college outreach programme, where I joined peer discussion groups to consider various social issues. This made me look at chemistry in the context of ethical dilemma and its position in the causes or solutions. I read papers that delve into the set of ethical issues that chemists face, as a chemist's research can have unimaginable effects, such as environmental degradation or the use of chemical weapons in war. As chemists are the ones developing these substances they must confront the ethical implications, which showed me that a good chemist is aware of the bad parts of science, but that they're determined to do it right. I attended online taster lectures held by the University of Cambridge, which helped me get a feel for education beyond the setting I was used to. These taster sessions introduced me to the process of NMR, which particularly captivated me; The idea that you can determine the structure of a molecule by utilising spin states and energy levels had me enthralled. Engaging with this quickly proved valuable, as NMR appeared in the Cambridge chemistry challenge. The challenge pushed my thinking skills to their limits, giving me the chance to utilise techniques and knowledge I had developed independently, reflecting the effort I've put into immersing myself into the world chemistry.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nMy economics journey has been quite eventful this year; studying economics for the first time has led to ups and downs, but one thing is for sure: my curiousity and personal growth in this subject has led to my interest being sparked. Initially, the concept of how Economics has its everyday uses, as learnt in year 1 microeconomics grabbed my attention and how economics can be applied in various other topics – it is a very flexible subject. To explore further, I completed the University of Cambridge's 'Foundations of Finance' MOOC, where I delved into the quantitative side of economics, such as the calculations of equities. As a result of this, I realised that economics isn't just about theory—it's a powerful way to interpret and influence the world.\n\nQuestion 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nIn terms of preparedness for the course, I've actively developed the analytical skills economics demands. Competing in the Great British Economics Olympiad 2025 (where I progressed through two rounds) tested my ability to apply economic principles to complex, time-pressured scenarios. Similarly, earning a Gold award in the Maths IMC strengthened my problem-solving agility, which lead to me using this skill in weekly maths mentoring sessions, helping younger students grasp abstract concepts. Even my volunteering as a science club assistant has been surprisingly relevant—breaking down experiments for peers improved my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly, a skill vital for interpreting economic data. I also read Freakonomics by Levitt and Dubner—its unique approach revealed how data could decode human behaviour, from incentive-driven cheating to the hidden impact of names on success. This interest lead me to writing a critical review for my school journal pushed me to engage deeply with their methods, sparking my curiousity in how economic thinking challenges assumptions. On the topic of extended writing, I also took part in the 2025 essay competition hosted by the LSESU Economics Society, which resulted in directly improving my essay writing skills, developing my ability to read around the subject and correctly cite information where necessary. This research also fuelled my enjoyment on the topic of how AI can be both positively and negatively influential in the work place, in terms of economic growth.\n\nQuestion 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nBeyond school academics, I've learned to thrive in both collaborative and independent settings. As a volunteer for precinct computer room monitoring, I balanced assisting peers with managing my own workload—a foundational skill that mirrors the self-discipline needed for the stepping stone into degree-level study. Furthermore, through the STEM Smart Programme, I contribute to weekly maths problems designed to develop critical thinking, sharpening my ability to frame problems creatively and explain solutions logically. Also, on a slightly more personal note, I have noticed myself start to think about scenarios through a more economical lens; for example, my father works in a fairly modest corner shop. This naturally resulted in some of our conversations drifting toward his work-life such as demand and supply or how external shocks e.g. a heatwave melting chocolate, can shift consumer behaviour, reducing overall purchases and then lowering demand. At times, I have helped out at the shop myself. Initially, I saw this as just a waste of time and a distraction, but this experience opened my eyes – showing me how closely economics connects to everyday life, even in a small retail setting. From observing how pricing decisions were made to weighing the cost-benefit of stocking certain products over others, I began to recognise the practical application of theories I have encountered in class. What I first perceived as a loss of study-time and a distraction became an invaluable to develop time management skills, gain insight into microeconomic principles in action, and deepen my enthusiasm for the subject. This experience, along with my achievement in the Economics Olympiad, has taught me how to approach open-ended questions methodically and has enabled me to grow as a person. With this foundation of skill and enthusiasm, I look forward to embracing university economics as the next stage in my prospective journey.",

    "statement_full_text": "Q1) My interest in politics and economics stems from a desire to understand how sustainable growth and prosperity can be achieved in developing nations.\nWatching a lecture by Dercon on 'Gambling on Development', I agreed with the notion that the commitment of elites to growth over rent-seeking is key to long-run growth. I found this convincing when applied to my home country, Sri Lanka. Elites pursued political gain through populist policies, such as large tax cuts, contributing to the country's economic crisis.\nReading North's 'Violence and Social Order', I concluded that inclusive political institutions and open markets are key in explaining why 'open access order' societies achieve greater economic growth. When applying North's theory to Dercon's 'development bargain', I found that Dercon was focusing his argument on whether elites are committed to moving from a basic natural state to a mature state. Yet, a mature state may not evolve into an 'open-access order', depending on whether elites choose to use the state's institutions to promote broader societal development. This led me to conclude that Dercon's 'development bargain' only describes a particular stage of institutional development in North's theory, undermining his argument that a development bargain will necessarily lead to growth. I was particularly convinced by North's argument that rents created through state intervention can serve positive purposes, especially Schumpeterian rents that incentivise innovation. I found this exemplified by China's state-led industrial and technological policy, where deliberate rent creation underpinned rapid growth.\nQ2) Studying A-level politics exposed me to the Westminster model, where power is concentrated in the executive. This creates a \"tyranny of the majority\" which often limits considered policymaking. This led me to question whether a consensus democracy might better serve the UK. I found Lijphart's 'Patterns of Democracy' convincing in its case for consensus democracy, particularly wider power-sharing to limit executive overreach and reduce the risk of misguided policies, such as Blair's invasion of Iraq. My studies in economics led me to question how globalisation and macroeconomic policy constrain redistribution. Rodrik's 'Globalization paradox' challenged my assumption that freer trade is inherently beneficial, showing that gains from further liberalisation are limited and involve significant redistributive trade-offs, as income and jobs decline for workers in less competitive sector. I found his proposal to liberalise labour mobility compelling. However, his claim that democracies should preserve domestic distributional bargains was unconvincing. These bargains, which are agreements on how gains from globalisation are shared, often favour profitable industries while offering limited support for low skilled workers. This can deepen inequality. This led me to question how globalisation's benefits could be distributed more equitably.\n\nQ3) Selected for an International European Youth Parliament session, I developed research skills through exploring the 'brain drain'. Leading Model UN society strengthened my ability to construct and defend arguments. A MOOC deepened my interested in the relationship between inequality and growth. I contrasted Kuznet's view that inequality naturally declines with development with Piketty's argument that capitalism inherently sustains it. Yet, I found both perspectives unconvincing, as globalisation has produced uneven effects on inequality. I found Lakner and Milanovic's 'Elephant curve' convincing in demonstrating how middle-income groups in emerging economies saw significant reductions in inequality, while low-income workers in advanced economies experienced stagnation. I questioned how inequality could be addressed. This inspired me to write an article exploring Milanovic's proposal to reduce concentration of capital, which I argued could be achieved through the creation of a social welfare fund.",

    "statement_full_text": "My motivation to study law, stems from an experience that offered first-hand insight into its impact. My mother suffered from a stressing incident of medical negligence while receiving treatment during pregnancy; seeing the repercussions of a traumatic experience with the legal case that affect her, and my family ignited a passion to change the legal system and protect the rights of minorities and individuals who are entitled to fair representation and equal access to opportunities of justice. As I see it, law is the foundation of democracy as it sets to exemplify how people should be treated, how justice is upheld and how voices should be heard. My devotion to the study of law was furthered when I read Elizbeth Rosenthal's 'American Sickness' which while not focused on the United Kingdom, it impacted me as it offers a forewarning for any healthcare system. As it challenges lawyers and policymakers to rethink what ethical, patient -centred care and accountability should look like in the future, to continue meeting the standard of treatment we have established as a society want for ourselves. The topic of society and social change further reinforced my motivation to study law, as I have always been increasingly aware of the systemic inequalities that have been purged onto minorities and by engaging in discussion with a wide range of people who have different opinions on law-based debates it created a thirst to learn more from others experiences and debates in the profession. The podcast 'The Law Show' by BBC Radio 4 gave me a chance to broaden my knowledge on specific controversial topics. From the topic of assisted dying to the redevelopment of AI laws while also allowing me to form my opinion on how lawyers must be able to navigate picking between complex decisions that reflect on society.\n\nWhile studying the African American Civil rights development as part of my module, we discussed and learnt about the evolution of laws and talked heavily about the societal change from 1863 to present day. The amendment laws to the Jim Crow laws became fascinating to me as a young black individual who was interested in the limited rights of black people to equality. Law is deeply based in historical events and showed me the growth of the legal systems in response to protests, politics, power, and origins of legal principles. It impacted the symbolisms of cases and historical knowledge to me through cases like Brown v The Board of education and Plessy V Ferguson. I researched heavily into key lawyers such as Thurgood Marshall and how his legal knowledge impacted the success of Civil Rights for Black Americans. It gave me insights on the principles of being a lawyer and how it may seem like a minor change to others it creates a massive impact on another individual.\n\nI have delved into cases and trials myself by participating in my school's law societies mock trials. This allowed me to gain a deep understanding on how to gather information and the process of how legal cases plays out. I developed crucial skills that are used in law namely critical thinking and legal reasoning which allowed me to analyse facts, interpret legal principles, and build argument based on the evidence that was presented to me. I have also taken part in a psychology society where I delivered a presentation on the case of Utah vs Ruby Franke and Sara Sharif trial. This allowed me to home in on my skills of researching a case that was being highly debated and explore how the legal system responds to abuse and child protection laws. This experience deepened my knowledge of how the law interacts with mental health evidence and the justice's systems responsibility to protect the vulnerable.\n\nMy inquisitiveness for law flourishes outside of formal education, I have taken active steps to prepare for a career in law by immersing myself in both legal experiences and broader personal development. I am an active member of my school's law society I engaged with junior solicitors, apprentices and trainee lawyers which allowed me to gain first-hand insight into the realness of legal practice. Their acumen on casework and career routes helped me appreciate the complexity and human impact of law.\n\nMy commitment to the Silver and Gold Duke of Edinburgh Awards have equally been formative. Leading expeditions and coordinating group responsibilities have cultivated leadership, resilience and problem-solving-qualities that mirror the pressures and ethical responsibilities of faced legal professionals. During the volunteer component I volunteered at an elderly care charity which reinforced my awareness of social accountability, particularly in supporting marginalised groups, aligning closely with my interests of medical negligence law where outcomes profoundly affect individuals lives and wellbeing.\n\nTo enhance upon this foundation, I have participated in a range of legal and business enrichment programmes including Slaughter and May's virtual law experience, the University of Brighton outreach and Surrey's Scholar events, Lloyds Bank insight scheme, Springpod, and the Power up seminar for aspiring lawyers. These experiences exposed me to key areas of commercial law, client interaction, and the business side of legal services, while also promoting reflection on accountability in professional environments which is an idea central to clinical negligence cases.\n\nAs Head of student Diversity and inclusion, I have led initiatives that promote representation and fairness within my school community. Developing skills in communication and ethical leadership. My involvement with the Doncaster Youth Council and speaking in the House of Commons in parliament where I debated the advocation of more mental health professional training in schools further sparked my interest in the interface between legal structures and public accountability. Outside these activities I balance my academic studies with competitive first team and Club netball and school hockey which has instilled discipline, focus, ability to perform under pressure and competition. Traits I consider vital for the success in the legal field.",
