    "statement_full_text": "My interest stems from what makes a policy successful or not. I looked at the impact on inequality of a conditional cash transfer in Brazil and Chile. After researching some articles, I found that it had a huge reduction in the Gini index for measuring inequality of 2.7 points whilst in Chile it was only 0.1 points. Whilst Chile's program was better targeted, the percentage of cash compared to income was only 0.01% and didn't contribute to reducing inequality, Brazil's program was less targeted but was 0.5% of income and was the second most important for reducing inequality. They were both unconditional cash transfers in countries with high inequality, yet the impact was very different and even though 0.5% is small, it is still enough to help make an impact. This led me on to Poor Economics which showed how small design choices can greatly alter the impact of a policy. This made me think that policies don't always fail because they are a bad idea but rather because small details and context are overlooked. Therefore, for a policy to be effective institutions and societal structures need to be analysed, it can't just be a good idea. I was intrigued by how economic models and evaluation tools can be built to predict if a policy will work in a different setting. So, I read an article on J-PAL about a six-stage intervention program in Bangladesh to help the ultra-poor including skills training for a productive asset. Evaluation led by Bandiera found a 38% increase in income over four years and was later adapted to Ghana with a higher focus on savings and support as rural finance access was limited. This showed me that analysis of local context is important for an intervention to succeed. \n\nAfter learning about regression in A level maths, I wanted to learn more about modelling in economics. So, I read Mastering Metrics' which taught me different econometric techniques and the different contexts they can be applied to. I then read an article that used regression analysis to find the effect of increasing minimum wage on employment. It found that when human capital investment is low, increasing minimum wage decreases employment but when investment is high, it increases employment. Regression allowed them to control for characteristics of the firm, compare firms with high and low human capital and the quantified results into a 10% difference between the two firms. Through the opposing effects, I was interested by how important external factors are to the impact of a policy and how econometric techniques can be used to quantify the impact. So, I looked further into how these techniques were used in the effect of increased minimum wage on employment. I read Card and Krueger's article where they used difference-in-differences techniques comparing New Jersey and Pennsylvania and found it didn't affect employment. I realised how econometrics can help challenge assumptions and create evidence from data. This is something I would like to explore further at university by applying my mathematical ability to an economic context to find out what makes policies successful. \n\nI was intrigued by why most western countries' growth has slowed but developing economies are advancing at a much faster rate. This led me to the Solow model which explained using links between capital, labour and technology that eventually, countries' growth will plateau as only technology will account for higher growth. It also explains why developing countries grow rapidly as they can catch up to the plateaued level already reached by the West. I still questioned why some countries seem to stay poor, so I looked for adaptions of the model. I read an article by Mankiw, Romer and Weil which adds human capital to the equation which explains that differences in education and skills account for the lack of growth. It expanded my view of how growth of the world works, and how countries can catch up through targeted investment in education to similar levels of the West.",

    "statement_full_text": "To improve policy design and lessen global inequality, I am motivated to understand why some development programs are successful whilst others aren't. I'm particularly interested in how mathematical reasoning can improve policy evaluation by separating correlation from causation, bridging theory and impact. So, I read Poor economics by Banerjee and Duflo, whilst I found their new evidence-based approach to behavioural economics of the poor convincing, I think the generalisation of results produced from randomised trials not to be useful as they have failed to be reproduced across the world and have a real impact on policy. It challenged some of my assumptions about poverty but made me question the limits of RCTs. This led me to Mastering Metrics which taught me a range of econometric techniques. I was most intrigued by difference in differences as it is a clear way to evaluate how two different policies side by side for better evaluation. But I realised that external shocks could distort results, highlighting to me why careful model design and proper interpretation are as important as the maths. I was curious to find real applications of these methods and was led to an article by Pierre Dubois about the effects on education after Progresa (a conditional cash transfer) was introduced. Using randomised rollout, the policy's true impact was revealed, which shows how mathematical methods can help evaluate economic policy. This showed me how maths helps to uncover the true impact, not just what is on the surface. However, as mentioned above, just because it worked in Mexico, doesn't mean it is one size fits all as analysis of the material conditions, institutions and society are needed to create an effective policy.\nFor my Spanish IRP, I researched the effect of Mexico's policies on inequality and poverty. Alongside Progresa, I discovered that while minimum wage legislation decreased inequality, their effects were lowered by tax evasion and corruption, leaving 35% of people living in poverty. I learned that poor institutions lessen the impact of well-designed ideas, therefore policies alone are insufficient. At university, I want to build the econometric skills needed to evaluate and optimise such policies so that next time, they lower inequality and alleviate poverty.\nWanting to know how maths can fix these structural problems, I explored linear programming through Balkan's thesis on development planning in India. What struck me was the ability of optimisation to highlight trade-offs, not just maximise GDP short term, such as investment in education and infrastructure leads to higher long-term growth. It showed me how mathematical methods are not just abstract yet have real impact by revealing hidden costs and benefits of policies. However, I spotted its reliance on fixed assumptions about technology and growth which are rarely stable in developing economies. This led me to different approaches such as the Solow model which suggests long-term growth is dependent on technology. This contrast with linear programming shows why some countries don't catch up despite lots of investment. Reading a critique by Abesalom Webb I saw how it underestimated the ability to adopt new technologies due to the lagging of institutions and policies. I realised that by knowing the flaws of each model, more effective policy can be designed. It made me think that effective policy needs to address both the supply side with incentives for investment and demand side through the creation of new markets for these technologies. The analysis of different models is a skill I would like to explore further at university so I can have a better understanding of the best strategies for developing countries.\nDuring a placement with First Bus in the data and analytics department I analysed datasets to extract patterns which inform the company's decisions. It showed me how mathematical tools can be used to guide decisions, whether in business or public policy. It furthered my interest in applying maths to solve complex problems and create solutions.\n\nAll these experiences have strengthened my analytical ability and deepened my interest in how data shapes policy. By studying economics, I want to use my mathematical ability, to better analyse policy and create solutions with measurable impacts.",

I was puzzled by how this disease can not only overcome, but actively benefit from its interactions with the components of both innate and adaptive immunity to drive its own proliferation. The tumor appears almost as a sentient being, changing itself in response to the constant immune selection pressure placed on the unstable tumor cells held in \"equilibrium,\" which may then enter the \"escape\" phase.\n\nThis concept sparked my interest in understanding how cancer takes advantage of our own defense systems to turn them against themselves, such as in the case of upregulation of PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 receptors on T cells, leading to functional exhaustion and inhibition of anti-tumor activity. A similar mechanism works with TGF-beta, IL-10, and IDO.\n\nBuilding on this mechanism, I decided to focus my thesis on Immunology, specifically on the protumoral and antitumoral gene clusters of macrophages present in the metastatic liver environment. The basis for my work was an article, published both in Nature and on the National Institutes of Health website, titled \"Alterations in Inflammatory Macrophage Niche Drive Phenotypic and Functional Plasticity of Kupffer Cells,\" which highlights the heterogeneity of macrophage populations in liver metastasis.\n\nBefore starting my thesis work, I had already explored the concept of phenotypic alterations in macrophages induced by tumor signals during a Bioinformatics course. For this course, I chose to personally analyze, through Differential Expression (DESeq2), GO Enrichment Analysis, and GSEA, the samples from a study involving murine models divided into normal and tumor-bearing subjects, due to my personal interest in the topic. The study is titled \"CD169⁺ Lymph Node Macrophages Have Protective Functions in Mouse Breast Cancer Metastasis\" and can be found on the National Institutes of Health website. I obtained the raw data by consulting the Expression Atlas database, where it is listed as experiment E-MTAB-8482.\n\nI am extremely interested in this course because I come from a solid bioinformatics background, and the Oxford Department of Oncology seems like the perfect place for me to gain deeper insights into the topics I have already studied, but not yet fully explored to satisfy my curiosity and passion.\n\nMy work ethic reflects my enthusiasm for learning and facing challenges. During my first year of university, I privately tutored high school students while also serving as a student representative; a role I have continued every year of my Bachelor's degree. In the past year, I also began working as an assistant at the library of Experimental Medicine here at La Sapienza University, where I have further honed my organizational skills and ability to balance studying with other activities; traits I believe are essential to pursue a demanding academic path.\n\nI am eager to contribute to the Oxford community and use this opportunity to grow both as a researcher and as a critical thinker.",

    "statement_full_text": "Q1: Relentless in my ambition to be useful, PPE's multidisciplinary rigour will equip me with the analytical skills required to contribute purposefully to some of the most complex societal problems. I was fascinated by Alison Hills' lecture on whether equality is a necessary condition which applied Rawl's veil of ignorance to imagined societies. Initially, a society with stark inequality, in which it would be unknown where one would end up, felt disconcerting. Yet the introduction of a third society, where all were equally badly off through levelling down was clearly worse than inequality with prosperity. This challenged my intuitive approach to the idea of equality. I concluded that equality matters to the extent of securing fairness and social mobility for the least advantaged. This a view that respects the dignity and complexity of human life. My conclusion drove me to question how the rightness and fairness of actions are determined.\n\nQ2: To explore these questions further, I completed a Harvard University MOOC on Justice, where I came across Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarianism as maximising pleasure over pain. I found this approach inadequate. By treating experience as a binary, it disregards the richness and depth of human life. Crisp's \"Haydn and the Oyster\" thought experiment made this vivid. Whilst the oyster's mild sensual pleasure numerically yields greater utility, most agents would select the musician's finite though intellectually rich life. This encapsulates my view that higher pleasures such as artistic achievement and intellectual thought distinguish humans and uphold their dignity. The widespread occurrence of mindlessly scrolling on social media fails to engage intellectual capacity. This reinforced my view that justice should consider the quality rather of human pleasure rather than purely maximising pleasure.\n\nIn the process of completing the MOOC I was surprised to find that the result of the Phillip Moris study which was a cost benefit analysis for smoking in the Czech Republic led to the conclusion that there was a net finance gain of $147 million a year. Reading an academic article that critiqued this I was not surprised to find that there were erroneous assumptions that were made. As an inaugural recipient as the Ashmolean Economics tutorials at my school, I had argued in support in response to the question: 'Economics is wrong but sometimes useful' where I argued that the assumptions made in Economics can often lead to misleading conclusions which can lead to not getting closer to the truth and leaving the public with uncertainty, as was the case with HS2. The fact that Philip Moris used their philanthropy as a source of lobbying was counter-intuitive morally though it was economically justified on an individualistic basis. Answering Caius Explore's essay competition question on whether lobbying is good or bad for the economy and society I concluded that lobbying is especially bad for society as it leads to a degradation in societal welfare and that it harms the economy by decreasing productivity and increasing barriers to entry for new firms due to rent seeking that takes place. This diverts resources toward political influence according to Bombardini and Trebbi's paper on empirical models of lobbying.\n\nQ3: Entering the St John's Poster competition on the theme of imitation, I pursued an exploration into my question of whether moral virtue can be developed through imitation alone. Whereas I originally strongly agreed with Aristotle's ideas in Nichomachean Ethics, that by observing and imitating role models one's character can be developed since \"We become just by doing just acts\", I no longer think that someone can be truly be seen as just only due to their outward actions. Intention has to conjoin the action. Kant's Categorial imperitative which incorporates reason and intention provides a better guideline for moral actions.\n\nWhen I read Dharshini David's The Almighty Dollar, learning about China's investment in countries such as Ethiopia linked to the resistance against giving aid in the fear that this would create dependency. Whilst I think that tied aid is a means to exploit countries need of assistance, I think that prosperous individuals in prosperous countries have a responsibility to redistribute their wealth. This led to my curiosity in effective altruism where I wanted to know if its focus on rationality was effective in the sense of being able to harness donations. Thus, I conducted a project where I investigated the extent to which emotions influence giving. I concluded that giving should be celebrated and it should not be done so strictly as it will drive people away from this philosophy, and when emotion is utilised in the process of persuasion, it can encourage charitable giving.\n\nPPE offers the discipline to pursue an understanding of the mechanisms that create a fair society and this real-world relevance motivates me.",

    "statement_full_text": "1. Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nComputer science captivates me by its use of structured logic and rules in solving profoundly complex problems. When first learning about Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm, I was struck by how a simple priority queue could always guarantee the most optimal path. Reading \"The New Turing Omnibus\" deepened my appreciation for this elegance; even minimal systems such as a Turing Machine can, in theory, be used to simulate any algorithm. Yet this sparked deeper questions: What makes some solutions fundamentally more efficient than others? What defines whether a problem is computable? Do learning systems in modern AI confront to the same limits as traditional algorithms? Whether deterministic or adaptive, I hope to delve further into how different systems abstract and generalise to encode reasoning, and where they hit boundaries.\n\n2. How have your qualifications and studies helped you prepare for this course or subject?\n\nStudying Mathematics and Further Mathematics have challenged me to think laterally in problem-solving. I relish in using proofs to understand why a formula works rather than just accepting it. Constructing inductive arguments and using them to reason about recursion and scale and computing derivatives from first principles are just as gratifying. This curiosity was extended through achievement of distinction in the Euclid Contest, where I solved a combinatorics problem by counting edge cases and defining recursions.\n\nI have expanded my interest in algorithmic efficiency through competitions such as the Beaver Computational Thinking Challenge and the Malaysian Computing Challenge. In the latter, I faced an optimisation problem requiring the minimal valid solution across a 10⁶-element dataset. I implemented a binary search variant that exploited monotonicity, reducing runtime from O(n) to O(log n). This emphasised how asymptotic analysis is not merely theoretical, but dictates the boundary between tractable and intractable solutions. Inspired by this experience, I turned to Quanta Magazine's article on computational complexity, where the distinction of P vs NP fascinated me. The idea that some problems (such as solving a sudoku) can be easily verified but not efficiently solved suggests that there are deeper limitations in our computational frameworks.\n\n3. What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nOutside the classroom, one of my interests is machine learning. I am drawn to its applications as well as how it formalises learning as function approximation. Through the Stanford Online MOOC, I studied how models generalise by minimising loss over training data, and how overfitting can be avoided through regularisation. Through my reading of \"Why Machines Learn\", I explored how learning systems approximate functions based on example data points. Intrigued by Cybenko's universal approximation theorem of how neural networks can approximate any continuous function given enough nodes, I implemented a PyTorch network to approximate sin(x) and sin(100x). It was easier for the network to learn low-frequency functions compared to high-frequency functions, which required deeper model architecture, this signals the trade-off between model depth and performance.\n\nDuring the Malaysian AI Olympiad in March 2025, I engineered features and tuned neural networks to solve an NLP classification task. My efforts earned me a silver medal as well as an invitation to the national team training programme. In a Xplore AI hackathon, my team developed a scam call detection system through logistic regression, achieving an accuracy rate of 70% on unseen data. These projects have shown me that thoughtful implementations of AI can be beneficial in solving real-world problems. In my free time, I nurture a growing passion for STEM in others by designing graphics as part of my school's robotics club and volunteering as a math tutor for underprivileged students. These experiences have honed my ability to communicate complex ideas accessibly, which will be useful for collaborative problem-solving in computer science.",
