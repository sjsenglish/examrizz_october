    "statement_full_text": "It is alarming that despite unprecedented access to information, solutions to pressing issues remain elusive. This gap draws me to PPE as it unites economic, political, and philosophical perspectives to find these solutions. Wealth inequality demonstrates this: whilst widely acknowledged as a problem, solutions are polarised. Byrne's 'The Inequality of Wealth' proposed reforms such as sovereign wealth funds, pension reform, and employee share schemes, which struck me as more creative than the sloganised call to 'tax the rich'. I realised that tackling inequality requires not just technical fixes but reimagining ownership and opportunity. While Byrne's support for a larger state made me reconsider the role of government, my time at the Eton Summer School taught me the practical realities of a free market. I analyzed how bond yields directly impact mortgage rates, deepening my understanding of how macroeconomic factors shape individual lives. It became clear to me that any policy solution must balance ideological goals with practical considerations as loss in confidence of a government could erode trust, raising yields and worsening housing affordability. Wanting to test the optimism of Byrne's reforms further, I attended the Marxism Festival 2025. I interviewed a SWP organiser but the interaction left me sceptical of the belief that workers and firms would prioritise moral over profit motives, and I noticed how some proposals risked eroding freedom through enforced equality. Reading Mill's 'On Liberty' clarified my views: I admired his defence of liberty and the harm principle, but questioned what constitutes harm; a question which I hope studying political philosophy will help answer. To explore these tensions, I presented at school on whether, as Friedman claims, free markets maximise freedom, or whether state involvement is essential to secure equal opportunity and reduce inequality. I also examined taxation - whether redistribution increases liberty or reduces economic freedom. This led to my Oxplore competition entry, where I argued in favour of a wealth cap, challenging assumptions about wealth migration. Despite Friedman's ideas of economic liberty being convincing, the widening wealth divide provides evidence that capitalism in its current form struggles to address inequality, suggesting the need for new solutions. Studying public economics in PPE will mature these opinions so I may address these issues further. Researching wealth caps, I encountered criticisms of state inefficiency. Consequently, I read Freedman's 'Failed State'. He exposed the dangers of over-centralisation and outsourcing, deepening my scepticism of current government institutions. Like Byrne, Freedman discussed issues and solutions often absent from mainstream debate. I explored this disconnect in my Kavitah Singh PPE essay on populist right support. Real economic issues, like those caused by outsourcing failures, are often ignored in favour of simpler social issues around immigration. Without understanding the economic underpinnings of social issues, any political solution risks being incomplete, emphasising how crucial studying politics and economics in tandem is. This inquiry into institutional failure continued in my John Locke essay, shortlisted for best economics entry, which addressed whether state or charity management could offset profit-driven behaviour. Despite my concerns with socialism at Marxism 2025, I concluded that democratic accountability could substitute for the price mechanism to guarantee fair pricing and quality, justifying state ownership. Machiavelli demonstrated the historical importance of this accountability when he warned that dissatisfied people replacing their rulers often find little change, a concept resonating with the recent change of governing party failing to improve public satisfaction. Only PPE equips me with the tools to test ideas against reality, moving beyond ideological gridlock and towards pragmatic solutions.",

    "statement_full_text": "The unique ability engineering has to shape our planet's future, through bold ideas and creative solutions, is what I admire most about the subject. My fascination began with the LEAF course 'Mathematics of Morality', which introduced me to effective altruism – how we can maximise our impact by tackling problems with both scale and severity. This drew me to the climate crisis, and through the BBC's podcast 'The Climate Question' I discovered the key role engineers play in reinventing technologies to reduce emissions. It fascinates me how one engineer's vision can spark global change, like Stiesdal creating the wind turbine that led Denmark to become a leader in renewable energy. His work inspired me to complete a research project with SATRO, investigating challenges with wind turbines, like fluctuating output and increasing size, and how engineers address these with solutions like smart grids and floating wind farms. The project also introduced me to Bernoulli's principle and catalysed my interest in fluid mechanics, which I look forward to studying in greater depth.\nThrough A-Level Maths and Physics, I have built problem-solving and critical thinking skills, showcased in Olympiads like the MOG (Merit) and SMC (Gold). These have been developed when tutoring Year 8 students, where I felt my ability to adapt was refined. As a head prefect, I have strengthened my communication and organisation skills by planning and executing events with my team, preparing me for collaborative work at university. Earning a Merit in the Immerse Education Essay Competition enabled me to gain researching and analysis skills. I answered the question 'How can engineering design foster innovation and sustainability?' and recognised how prioritising sustainability enhances innovation – for example if engineering companies spend more money on clean products; they are motivated to innovate more cost-effective designs.\nTo explore engineering and the climate crisis further, I completed a MOOC on electric cars, studying the challenges they face and their role in the energy transition. This sparked my curiosity in the future of transport. Intrigued to understand how EVs work, I read Larminie's book 'Electric Vehicle Technology Explained', where I particularly enjoyed learning the power electronics of motors. It fascinates me how engineers are able to make uses for wasted energy, for example in regenerative braking, and I want to be able to contribute to designing solutions where challenges are turned into opportunities. Discovering different electric cars inspired me to design my own in an extended project, using TinkerCAD to plan the chassis and coding a remote-controlled steering system. I built a solar powered charging station to model how cars can be powered from renewable energy. I found it rewarding to transform a simple idea into a functioning project, and this creative process draws me to a degree in engineering.\nDuring a week of work experience at Air Products, I was introduced to hydrogen as an energy store and a fuel for cars. This led me to question why engineers favour manufacturing battery electric cars over fuel cell powered cars, when the latter have a longer range. However, reading Larminie's book allowed me to discover the complexity of providing the right conditions for fuel cells and storing hydrogen. I concluded that it would be more economical to continue improving infrastructure for BEVs, which can be charged in more places - hydrogen is a better option for bus or tram networks.\nLearning the challenges of wind turbines, electric cars and the wider barriers to climate action has strengthened my desire to study engineering, a field with potential for meaningful impact. Reading MacKay's argument that we can't rely purely on renewable energy and will have to look to alternatives in his book 'Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air', was thought provoking. It highlighted to me not only the scale of the challenges ahead, but also the vast realm of possibilities available. Through engineering, I hope to turn these ideas into practical solutions that shape a sustainable future.",

    "statement_full_text": "Studying medicine is a lifelong fundamental goal of mine. My journey towards preparing for a medical career has ranged from times of triumph and fascination, to times of failure, but it always ultimately concludes with further commitment, further aspiration, never diminishing my ambitious medical mindset. My interest in general practice initially sparked through the experience of patient care and consideration. From past experiences, the care I had received was phenomenally effective at minimizing consistent fears of my health whilst remaining respectable, a feature which I have deep admiration for and I believe is a core component of general practice, as every patient is entitled to empathetic and personalised care. Two further factors would be my fascination with the human body, with its consistency of functionality, despite endless complexities, and its response to viruses and diseases, two factors constantly progressing due to education. All these factors make up what I view as a trinity of my medical ambitions, all areas of interest which I believe correspond perfectly and exclusively to a career in general practice.\n__\nInitially my pursuit for a medical career began with up-taking medical society within my school. Within this activity, I would partake in further medical practical work beyond my current curriculum, such as experimentation with blood antigens. Within these practical works I would develop a range of skills such as communication with peers, listening and precisely following instructions, and furthermore deepening my medical knowledge. It is vital to develop these skills as are all aspects which will required and tested within a medical degree.\n\nFurthermore, to expand my knowledge in human response to disease, which is a fundamental topic within medicine, I researched topics such as the rabies virus, such as the article \"Rabies is still a fatal but neglected disease: a case report\" published by The Journal of Medical Case Reports. Within this article it describes the origins of the rabies virus and people most affected by the virus by presenting examples of the fatality of this virus and its global severity through statistics and descriptions of countries most susceptible to the virus, such as low income countries. In my opinion, although this case is factual in presenting the fatality of rabies, I believe it lacks the demonstration of the major neglection of the disease.\n__\nFirstly, I take up boxing two times a week, a sport I am very passionate about, and piano lessons once a week. These activities severely tested my listening abilities, a skill essential for general practice for effective and respectful patient care which is the key to minimising time pressure of continuous appointments. Furthermore I take up volunteering for 2 hours a week in my local children's charity, a significantly beneficial activity to my pursuit of a career in general practice. This is colossal as it trains the skill of communication, through conduct of customers, the most vital skill into general practice, as i believe the most important aspect of general practice is the promise of compassionate and considerate care to patients, and without this, success of general practice could not happen.\n\nAdditionally I took up work experience within the King Norton's surgery. Within this i shadowed general practioners and nurses, observing their conduct with patients, online and in person. During these confrontations I observed distressed patients with fears of diseases such as cancers and the effective minimisation of these fears via effective communication and consideration. Furthermore I observed the analysis of pictures sent by patients, which used application of memory and effectual judgement of the general practioners. Then, I observed the general practioners ability to use complex computer applications to handle appointment upscaling and booking, which demonstrates the general practioner's ability to effectively adapt to difficult environments quickly and efficiency. These observations were extremely effective in giving me an insight to a typical day within a GP surgery, furthermore solidifying my ambition and passion for a career in general practice.",

    "statement_full_text": "I was introduced to the idea of economic interdependence through a TedTalk by Ian Bremmer. His argument that the US economy can no longer use its economic power to directly control others made me curious on how the US can even affect other economies. Looking through financial markets, I explored how the US elections can impact Egyptian markets in an internship at Naeem Holding (9/24). I analysed major indices and market reports to get a general idea on how markets behaved around elections, observing that prices are more volatile pre-election but rise after, regardless of which party takes office. Then I categorised the best performing sectors under various election outcomes and used technical analysis on firms from each sector to predict the firm's behaviour during the election. I found that large firms like Orascom outperform smaller firms because they are more diversified, handling shocks better which investors look for in uncertain times. Additionally, their international exposure means they're more responsive to foreign markets, boosting return when foreign markets rise post election.\n\nWith my interest in global networks, I wanted to explore global trade in our world model. So, I read a paper by the OECD on GVCs. I noted how tariffs in fragmented production processes are cumulative, making minimal tariffs costly downstream and that open trade laws are needed to promote GVC development in economies. This made me question the US' role in world trade and how that could change after it set costly tariffs. Drawing on Wolff and Krugman on The Economics Show, I saw how the US is a net importer where it absorbs trade surpluses of economies like China. This means that with the US stepping back from open trade, there will be a big surplus in the market. However, I realised that if economic powers like the EU and China promote trade by making new trade agreements, new consumers can be found in emerging economies to fill the loss in demand, allowing world trade to evolve.\n\nI was first drawn to Nudge theory from a MOOC on behavioural economics and public policy which showed me how small changes in framing can greatly affect outcome, challenging rational choice. Exploring further, I read Sunstein's Why Nudge which argued for libertarian paternalism to guide choices while preserving autonomy. While I was persuaded by his argument that people's errors due to their biases harm welfare, so governments should try to correct these losses, I also agreed with Sugden's critique that although nudges aim to keep freedom, the act of choosing a default isn't neutral and that policymakers can't claim to know people's 'true' choices. Overall though, I found myself agreeing more with Sunstein as in practice there is no neutral choice, so policy makers should use nudges to improve welfare.\n\nReading Less is More by Jason Hickel, I was struck by his argument that our capitalistic economy is worsening global warming, which challenged how free markets lead to maximum benefits through the incentive function. This led me to watching the lecture \"Climate capitalism: can market-based solutions save the planet?\" where speakers discussed how if policies like carbon pricing were implemented correctly a steep increase in the price of daily life would occur, driving hyperinflation. This made me question how effective current policies are with central banks prioritising inflation goals, so I researched how the EU ETS has influenced carbon reduction strategies of different size firms in high emission sectors. I found that mid-size firms respond better to the ETS, likely because the ETS' costs strongly affect them (unlike large firms which can absorb the costs) while having the ability to invest in new technologies and strategies which small firms lack. This led me to consider if a mix of market mechanisms and direct investment would best solve market failures.\n\nActing as head of the fundraising committee for my student council has developed my leadership and problem solving skills. Alongside this, engaging with topics like economic integration has deepened my appreciation of political systems and economics models. These experiences have strengthened my desire to explore and analyse the forces shaping global markets and society at university.",

    "statement_full_text": "I was introduced to the idea of economic interdependence through a TedTalk by Ian Bremmer; he argued that the US financial system can no longer affect global markets like during the 2008 financial crisis, making me curious on how the US can affect other economies today. I explored how the US elections can impact Egyptian markets in an internship at Naeem Holding's asset management division. I analysed S&P 500 and Nasdaq from 2004-2024 and historical election data from Morgan Stanley, learning that prices are more volatile before elections but rise after, regardless of which party takes office. Then I categorised the best performing sectors under different presidential, senate and house combinations and used technical analysis like chart patterns and moving averages on firms' stocks from each sector to predict the firm's behaviour during the elections. I found that large firms like Orascom outperform smaller firms because they are more diversified, handling shocks better which investors look for during uncertain times. Additionally, their international exposure means they're more sensitive to foreign markets, boosting return when foreign markets rise post election.\n\nWith my interest drawn to global networks, I wanted to explore how global trade occurred in our current world model. So, I read a report by the OECD on benefits of GVCs. I noted how tariffs in fragmented production processes are cumulative, making minimal tariffs costly downstream and that open trade laws are needed to promote GVC development in an economy. This made me question the role of the US' role in world trade and how that could change after it set costly tariffs. Drawing on Wolff and Krugman on 'The Economics Show', I saw how the US is a net importer where it absorbs trade surpluses of economies like China. This means that with the US stepping back from open trade, a big surplus will occur as they won't import as much so there will be excess supply. However, I realised that if economic powers like China promote open trade by making new trade agreements, then new consumers can be found in emerging economies which can fill the loss of demand, allowing world trade to evolve. Though there will still have to be a decrease in production due to the large size of the US market which will be lost.\n\nI was first drawn to Nudge theory from a MOOC on behavioural economics and public policy which showed me how small changes in framing can affect outcome, challenging rational choice. Exploring further, I read Sunstein's Why Nudge which argued for libertarian paternalism to guide choices while preserving autonomy. While I was persuaded by his argument that people's errors due to their biases harm welfare, so governments should try to correct these losses, I also agreed with Sudgen's critique that although nudges aim to keep freedom, the act of choosing a default isn't neutral and that policymakers can't claim to know people's 'true' choices. Overall though, I found myself agreeing more with Sunstein as in practice there is no neutral choice, so policy makers should use nudges to improve welfare.\n\nReading Less is More by Jason Hickel, I was struck by his argument that our capitalistic economy is worsening global warming, which challenged how free markets lead to maximum benefits through the incentive function. This led me to watching the lecture \"Climate capitalism: can market-based solutions save the planet?\" where speakers discussed how if policies like carbon pricing were implemented correctly a steep increase in the price of daily life would occur, driving inflation. This made me question how effective current policies are with central banks prioritising inflation goals, so I researched how the EU ETS has influenced carbon reduction strategies of different size firms in high emission sectors. I found that mid-size firms respond better to the ETS, likely because the ETS' costs strongly affect them (unlike large firms which can absorb the costs) while having the ability to invest in new technologies and strategies which small firms lack. This led me to consider if a mix of market mechanisms and direct investment would best solve market failures.\n\nActing as head of the fundraising committee for my student council has developed my leadership and problem solving skills. Alongside this, engaging with topics like economic integration has deepened my appreciation of political systems and economics models. This has strengthened my desire to explore and analyse the forces shaping global markets and society at university.",
