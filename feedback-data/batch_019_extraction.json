    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course or subject?\n\nMy fascination with the human mind and behaviour began on the day my mother fell ill, my emotions took over me and I sought to understand the drivers behind these complex feelings. I turned to psychology. 'Psychology Review' magazines combined with articles from 'Psychology Today' provided me with some answers. They allowed me to better understand my previously confusing emotions and solidify my appreciation for the study of human nature. The magazines enabled me to understand psychology's shifting research spotlight. However, reading several volumes made me realise that the subject's young nature leaves much ambiguity in explaining intricate behaviours. Each new discovery since the development of the study of the relationship between mind and behaviour within psychology has unveiled important findings on the nature of humans and yet also reveals just how little we know about it. The way that each credible, well-tested approach could be challenged by alternatives with differing strengths, captivated me.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\n\nIn my EPQ, I considered cognitive psychological theory and its applications, integrating findings from articles, books. I was able to apply my polished writing skills from being a monthly blog writer for a therapy clinic while developing my understanding of psychology's real world use. My role leading the diversity sub-committee, planning our school's culture week let me demonstrate my creativity and problem solving skills in addition to the perseverance and capability to see them through. While my initial A-level results did not reflect my true ability, the experience has driven me to refine my approach in order for me to get the best results I know I can achieve. This shift in mindset and motivation helped me optimise and develop a consistent and disciplined work ethic demonstrated by my ability to balance maintaining high quality standards in my academic studies, endorsed by teachers, alongside my two part time jobs.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nWork experience within primary school and my part time job as a teaching assistant sparked my interest in how the principles of psychology are used to tailor education to each child's assessed cognitive development. This led me to an article by Eleanor Leigh that outlined the importance of addressing early-age psychological barriers to learning, to promote long-term wellbeing and success. The discovery showed me that psychology is all around us and sparked a newfound respect for the cognitive aspect of psychology. I then read Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', which developed my understanding of concepts like different thinking systems and cognitive tendencies. I learnt more on this topic when discussing with the director of 'Bristol CBT Clinic' during work experience with them. Outcomes of CBT consultations and assessments gave me insights into the clinic's operations and its use of cognitive strategies to disrupt unhealthy thought patterns. I worked with CBT therapists and trainee clinical psychologists to design a survey to identify traits linked with social anxiety for patient treatment. After reading Bryan Cook's, 'The Importance of Evidence-based Practice', I understand that if you wish to draw conclusions they need to be backed up by evidence. I initially began a small experiment on one participant to investigate the phonological similarity effect. Further, in my summer group project, I investigated the relationship between ASD and dyslexia and used an AQ test and nonsense reading task on 21 participants to measure the two disorders. We found a positive correlation, foreshadowed by a range of past studies. However the experiment introduced me to issues like co-morbidity and the difficulties of quantifying such unique and complicated disorders. This, along with reading Ben Goldacre's 'Bad Science' taught me about the importance of scientifically credible experiments and awareness of cognitive biases. The profound complexity of human behaviour and endless potential to uncover new truths about ourselves drives me to understand and explore beyond the boundaries of what we know. My journey so far has only deepened my resolve to comprehend the link between mind and behaviour.",

    "statement_full_text": "Question 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject?\nHaving grown up in fisheries outside Karachi before moving into the city, I have lived in contrasting economic and geographic environments. Specifically, in Karachi concentrated jobs and infrastructure access highlighted agglomeration economies, which inspired me to read LSE's 'Spatial Inequality, Regional Growth and Economic Geography'. I disagree with the theory of conditional convergence because it assumes poor regions will naturally grow faster and catch up due to diminishing returns on capital and technology. In my experience, the opposite occurred: the gap widened as the cities advanced at the expense of stagnation in outer regions.This led me to consider Thomas Piketty's argument in 'Capital in the Twenty First Century' that inequality widens as wealth concentrates when the rate of return on capital exceeds economic growth, favouring progressive wealth taxation. However, I argue that traditional wealth solutions such as progressive wealth and capital gains taxes are unlikely to fully resolve inequality - since they can be regressive and encourage avoidance. For example, France's ISF raised only about €5 billion, around 2% of tax receipts, before it was terminated in 2018. I now aim to explore how developing nations such as my own can achieve a higher GDP per capita through applied econometrics.\nQuestion 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?\nAfter completing Stanford's MOOC on game theory,Jackson's remark, \"where you are decides what you become,\" introduced me to how geography shapes economic outcomes. Reene Ong's study showed how people living in flood ridden environments in Kelantan, Malaysia are trapped in debt because of land loss and rising insurance premiums. I explored this further in my essay for the John Locke essay competition, arguing that it fuels disaster capitalism, privatisation, and inefficiency, ultimately constraining sustainable and equitable development in the Kelantan region. Acemoglu's 'Why Nations Fail' echoes this, by showing how institutional quality often exploits these spatially vulnerable people. Without breaking this cycle, the framework of an ideal economy free of indebtedness remains abstract. Drawing on this understanding, I led a delegation at the National Policy Conference, where I agreed with Acemoglu that institutions must be less concentrated, bypassing bureaucracy to promote equal participation.\nAt the Centre of Economic Research Pakistan's summer school, I further investigated how reducing inequality contributes to sustainable development in Pakistan. Using non-linear regression with regularisation, I analysed the relationship between a redistributive policy index and access to climate resilient infrastructure. I found that, although Pakistan's inequality has improved since 2013, unsustainable development persists. I therefore suggested environmental taxes, lowering VAT on energy bills, and subsidising renewable energy in underdeveloped areas to stimulate economic growth through targeted sectoral policies, as advocated by Ha-Joon Chang.\nAttending a real estate masterclass by Dr. Hoeltken introduced me to evidence-based policy as a data driven approach for policy analysis. I sought to explore how different types of housing policies can influence inclusive economic outcomes. LSE's research stated that moderate regulation sustains tenant security without restraining supply, an argument reinforced by evidence that indexation prevents inflation-driven inefficiency. Ultimately this persuaded me that calibrated rent control systems, characterised by government intervention, provide higher macroeconomic outcomes to mixed systems by creating more responsible economic policies. While Diamond's work revealed long-term risks of embedded inequality and gentrification, I concluded that dynamic, carefully calibrated housing policies are necessary to mitigate inequality while remaining socially viable.\nQuestion 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nLast summer, I undertook an independent project on the central bank's push toward digital currencies. The IMF's analysis of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) made me question whether technology alone can democratise finance since payment and financial inclusion policy continues to shape access and distribution within financial systems. My internship at JS Bank provided evidence for my point, transaction data through visualisation revealed that about 87% of cash-dependent communities often remain digitally excluded. I believe CBDCs could effectively reinforce the inequality they seek to narrow by resorting to a new form of financial hierarchy: requiring specific digital literacy and internet access. Simultaneously, I tutored junior sixth form Maths students on integration which has equipped me with the appropriate skillset for problem solving and data analysis. I hope to advance these skills to properly understand the intersection of environmental sustainability and economics in developing nations such as mine.",

I disagreed with Chomsky's view that economic elites collude to \"manufacture consent\", instead, I believe polarisation in our media is rising precisely because there is no centre of control - and that this empowers extremists.\nTo what extent does imperfect information cause war? Almost entirely, I decided, after encountering the concept of ESSs presented by Dawkins, drawing heavily from Game Theory, modelling intrastate behaviour. I used Spaniel's framework to apply this to the Ukraine War, where, despite incurring costs by continuing to fight, bargaining frictions caused by imperfect information (as both sides' ability to fight is contingent on unpredictable factors such as foreign aid) elude solution. Yet, my view was challenged in \"Notes From the Underground\" where Dostoevsky challenges the essentiality of human rationality, which led me to question the central assumptions of neoclassical economics. Dostoevsky's view that over-rationalising our decisions dishonestly distances ourselves from our morality to me highlights the dangers of the \"banality of evil\" ever-present in our politics.\n\nHow have your qualifications or studies prepared you to study this subject?\nIn A-Level history, my teacher introduced me to the fascinating concept of \"Napoleon's dictum\", which argues that a person can be understood through the lens of the world when they were 20. I related this to notions of whether our wills can ever truly be \"free\" if they are so strongly influenced by the environment, a view I encountered from Sapolsky on the 'Within Reason' podcast. In my interpretation of \"The Stranger\", the moral and psychological control society seeks to impose on Meursault through his trial struck me as another example of social determinism. Moreover, this has led me to question whether freedom is paradoxical in a determinist universe: non-random events must be determined, but neither collapsing into pure randomness nor pure determinism seem to bring about freedom.\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and how have these experiences been useful?\nWhat is the best way to develop a poor country? I initially agreed with Acemoglu/Robinson's central thesis that inclusive institutions (such as those found in the settler-colonial structure of the US compared to quasi-feudal colonial México) are conducive to economic growth, which I found built of off Smith's initial observation that merchants and businessmen would try to rig markets in their favour. In my role as a writer for Etonomics, I argued that extractive institutions (such as the License Raj in India) are immoral because they perpetuate unequal economic control, exercised through elite networks. Sen's humanist capabilities-led approach took a similar approach to criticising political and economic unfreedoms; I found his argument for redefining development in terms of substantive freedoms compelling.\nLeading my school's MUN and philosophy societies, I researched democratic backsliding around the world. Learning about crackdowns on judicial independence, the separation of powers and military coups in sub-Saharan Africa affirmed my belief in the deontological and utilitarian reasons for free speech outlined in Mill's \"On Liberty\", which was a subject of study in Balliol College's Floreat programme.\nUltimately, PPE is vital for untangling the disparate causes of inequality, unfreedom and conflict present in the world.",

    "statement_full_text": "My interest in Physics began by watching Sean Carroll's lectures, \"The Biggest Ideas in the Universe\" which taught me how mathematics can shape our understanding of physics. Carroll introduced Lagrangian mechanics, a framework that uses the Euler-Lagrange equation to describe motion by finding the path of least action. I found it fascinating that more complex physics can be described through different models, realising that it extends far beyond Newtonian principles. I was amazed to also learn that the path integral, which considers all possible particle paths, allows the same concept to transcend classical mechanics and be generalised in quantum interactions. I noticed how theoretical physics may reveal links between the macroscopic and microscopic scales. I then explored other theoretical principles in Kumar's 'Quantum'. I was intrigued by the way complex numbers encode the probabilistic nature of quantum systems and capture both phase and amplitude. Through this, I recognised the many areas I'm eager to explore and developed an appreciation for how physics relates to abstract mathematics to provide more profound explanations of nature.\n\nDuring the Oxford Particle Physics Masterclass, I found it gratifying to see theory in practice through applied mathematics and data analysis. In trying to estimate the D0 meson lifetime, we were introduced to Gaussian fits, which modelled the meson's signal distribution, distinguishing it from background noise. Our calculated value was slightly off, but by constantly adjusting the IP bounds, we saw how the results shifted closer to the true value. This not only showed me the importance of persistence in problem-solving but also improved my understanding of how quantitative methods test theories. Building on these problem-solving experiences, I furthered my knowledge of Feynman diagrams by learning about Lorentz vectors, which describe the energy and momentum of particles at each vertex, and how to represent them in Python. This process made me realise I had previously overlooked the importance of coding, inspiring me to create projects in Python, such as a SUVAT calculator or an SHM simulation governed by differential equations. Having some experience will help me adapt to the computational aspects of the course.\n\nMy inspiration to enter Caius Explore stemmed from my time at Oxford, where we went over the Bullet Cluster and its evidence for dark matter. Initially, I regarded dark matter as more speculative rather than a concrete theory in physics. However, I was struck by the vast amount of observations and theoretical candidates that we have. For example, galactic rotation curves reveal an effect that matter alone cannot explain, whilst candidates such as axions are theorised to be necessary for the formation of early cosmic structures. Through participating I concluded that physics thrives on constantly new ideas, requiring adaptability and inspiring me to consider the other challenges driving modern physics. As a result, I read Rovelli's \"Reality Is Not What It Seems\" which explores the search for quantum gravity. I was struck by the fact that two established theories (general relativity and quantum mechanics) remain incompatible ,despite extensive research. Whilst I was able to piece some ideas on his loop quantum gravity, engaging with these topics highlighted the knowledge I lack, which I hope to develop on this course.\n\nI find engagement with the Physics community on a global level necessary to broaden my perspective on research in different fields. Learning Spanish demonstrates my desire to access this knowledge; aside from reading articles on 'Science Daily' and 'Quanta Magazine' , reading them in Spanish helps me work on my critical thinking by exposing me to different perspectives and ways of presenting ideas. Contributing locally by hosting a STEM club at a school lets me share my enthusiasm whilst enhancing my leadership skills and skills to explain concepts clearly.",

    "statement_full_text": "Few things are more difficult to watch than the body undermining its own survival. When my mum was diagnosed with Evans syndrome and Immune Thrombocytopaenia, it felt like witnessing a system built for survival repeatedly fail her. Medicine, to me, is the discipline that confronts this failure head on – not to promise perfection but to sustain, to stabilise and to restore some order to a broken mechanism. I came to appreciate how disease doesn't just disrupt the body; it disrupts a whole life. This understanding was deepened when reading When Breath Becomes Air which taught me that medicine is not only about fighting illness but also preserving dignity and meaning for those with uncertainty, reminding us that while death is inevitable and beyond out control, how we confront it is a profoundly human choice that connects us all – lessons that have stayed with me as I support my mum through her ongoing journey.\nThis personal connection has driven me to pursue academic challenges that deepen my understanding beyond the classroom. Among these, the Homerton Biology Challenge was particularly rewarding; I delved into the question \"Why do we dream?\" where I explored the neuroscience behind dreaming, earning a Distinction and A Badge of Merit for original thought. The challenge sharpened my ability to explore intricate biological concepts with curiosity and attention to detail. Similarly, the STEM SMART programme connected me with Cambridge lecturers whose guidance fuelled my enthusiasm for rigorous research and a clearer understanding of the bigger academic picture. This is evident when my studies of meiosis and genetic variation at A-Level led me to discover the film The Birth of IVF, which revealed Jean Purdy's vital yet overlooked contribution to IVF's development, inspiring my Newnham Wool Prize essay The Other Diagnosis, where I explored the historical challenges women faced in medicine. Alongside consistent success in Challenges and Olympiads, these experiences have cultivated the analytical mindset and commitment I know will be essential in a medical career.\nAt Kingston Hospital's Head and Neck Stop Clinic, I witnessed an ENT consultant gently break the news to a lively patient that a lump in her throat might be cancerous. Seeing her shift from joy to quiet resignation brought home just how vulnerable patients are and how being a doctor means offering not just a diagnosis but real compassion and emotional support. This human side of medicine stayed with me when in a pharmacy, I recognised one of my mother's medications -Mycophenolate Mofetil - a familiar face in an unfamiliar place - reminding me how a wealth of resources connects countless lives through the shared care and responsibility of many healthcare professionals. Volunteering at a special needs school challenged me to think creatively and with empathy, understanding that true care often means going beyond standard approaches to truly represent each individual's needs.\nMy involvement in the Imperial Science in Medicine Prize, where I co-developed OxyDose - a smart, wearable patch that delivers rapid, discreet oxygen support during episodes of breathlessness - taught me the value of teamwork and practical solutions focused on real patient needs. Fundraising for UK-Med and running docquickies, a Tiktok platform simplifying medical topics, showed me how even small efforts - whether raising awareness or simplifying complex ideas can meaningfully impact the wider community. It affirmed my drive to make a difference, however modest, beyond the typical. Medicine might not always cure, but it always cares. I want to be that steady hand, offering support when it matters most.",
