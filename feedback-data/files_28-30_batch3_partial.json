I discovered my love for animals when in equine therapy I was paired with a horse, Ruby, and learned about equine care and common diseases. The compassion, care and bond I have developed during work experience has driven my interest and sense of purpose. As a vet I hope to take full responsibility for the animals in my care, choosing the medication and correct treatment.\n\nA-Level Biology and Chemistry have given me a thorough grounding in human anatomy and physiology, allowing me to identify specific comparisons in different types of animals. Maths is training my quantitative problem-solving skills. I enjoy independently researching different diseases like Hemangiosarcoma in dogs. The limited treatment options and the fast growth tumour on the lining of blood vessels led me to read Jennings and Premanandan's 'Veterinary Histology', which explained the structure of blood vessels. I went on to research the Maltipoo breed and common diseases of dogs. James Heriot's 'Every Living Thing', 'The Good Lord Made Them All' and 'All Creatures Great and Small' and his TV shows increased my interest, as did a Disney Plus documentary, 'The Secret Life of Penguins'. I have also completed an online course on 'Do you have what it takes to be a veterinarian?'\n\nNetball has improved my teamwork, while boxing and personal training keep me fit, important for the stress relief a vet constantly needs. On lambing work experience I increased my empathy with animals, tube- and bottle-fed some sick lambs, and injected calcium and magnesium into a sick lamb. When a lamb was born, we sprayed iodine in the umbilical cord to prevent infection. I saw a ewe reject her lamb, which was fostered by another lamb, after rubbing the amniotic fluid to get the new ewe to accept the lamb. At the RVC's SSTS, I learnt about reptiles, spent a day in the farm learning about dairy cows, the volume of milk produced, and horn removal. I also learnt how to hold a chicken correctly to examine the feet and wings. I discovered the 6 basics of life: light, shelter, food, water, air and space. I learnt to pin down sheep to check the hoofs and udder, and did body scoring, using their teeth to tell the age. At equine I learnt how to put a headcollar and rug onto a horse, practising first on a mannequin before performing the procedure on a horse. I saw the various diagnosis images (CT, Xray, MRI and scintigraphy) offered in the equine referral hospital and examined ligaments, tendons and bones in the horse's legs. I listened to the horse's heart, lungs and bowels and learnt how to examine a horse for temperature, heart rate, breathing rate. On a house projection about snakes, I researched egg binding and improved my research skills. In the clinical-skills lab I practised bandaging a mannequin dog, practised doing the surgeon knot and learnt how to gown up and put on gloves post-sterilization. A TPLO was fascinating; I saw how carefully they placed the screws and the complexity of the surgery. I loved the problem solving, seeing how things fit together and how a few screws can make such a difference to a dog's mobility and quality of life. I was disturbed by the neutering of a pregnant homeless cat. The vets and nurses explained this was a common procedure, despite the danger of complications like hernia. This highlighted for me the ethical dilemmas vets must confront. Another cat in liver and renal failure received 4 days' palliative care; putting her to sleep was the kindest option but her owners found this deeply upsetting. I realized how the vet must balance the welfare needs of the animal and those of the owners, showing compassion and empathy throughout the whole process. Taking the paw prints and shaving some of the fur felt very meaningful, keeping the cat's memory alive. All this fires my ambition to serve and protect animals in a career as a vet.",

    "statement_full_text": "Engineering shapes every part of our lives, from the small details on our phones to the aircraft that transport people across the world. Each detail is crafted to enhance many different products. My interest in design and creativity began through playing video games, where I expressed myself by designing personal projects. This initial interest led me to pursue analytics behind social media trends. For my HPQ, I explored why videos go viral and the data related. This experience taught me to look beyond numbers and identify underlying patterns within them. The key turning point was visiting KROHNE, a local engineering company. I was fascinated by how complex products work in unison through precise measurement. My passion for aerospace engineering began with Formula 1, where aerodynamics and precision drive performance. I was captivated by the speed and intensity of the sport and listening to Susie Wolff and Claire Williams on Netflix's 'Drive to Survive,' I realised that, despite being male-dominated, motorsport offered different careers that I could aspire to pursue. I enrolled in an aerospace course where we explored the flight mechanics of foam gliders and designed a more optimised solution that would counter current weaknesses. This involved iterative testing and constant criticism of aerodynamic performance. Webinars hosted by InvestIn highlighted the realities of a career in engineering. I was drawn to the dynamic, unpredictability, and the demand for both adaptability and resilience. Next, I gained hands-on experience at Judd Power, utilising SolidWorks, where I designed 3D models, including an engine cover that was integrated into their design. This experience cemented my passion for design and my love for the fast-paced field of motorsport and aeronautics. Studying Product Design enhanced my interest in engineering and design, as it allowed me to develop skills, exploring CAD and CFD inspired me to do further research into their applications in engineering. I began watching Chain Bear on YouTube, discussing aerodynamics and taught me concepts, like downforce and vortex reduction. Managing the demands of my NEA coursework with three other subjects was a challenge, forcing me to develop my organisation and time management skills, ensuring I stayed on schedule and met personal deadlines. Pursuing Further Maths outside of school has been a challenge that has been pushed by my personal motivation. It has taught me the importance of self-directed study and of fully mastering a topic before moving on. In Physics and Maths Society at school, I presented complex topics such as the Dual-Axis Steering (DAS) system from the 2020 Mercedes F1 car, improving my confidence and communication of technical ideas. Beyond education, I took part in an online course run by TEDI. It was based on sustainable fashion, a topic that I had never considered for designing a product for, but found I really enjoy. This course challenged me to apply my design and reasoning skills in a new aspect of engineering and really pushed me out of my comfort zone. Outside of education, I am a member of my town's football team, where I have developed in skill, communication, and trust. Volunteering with a female karting team allowed me to gain practical experience with kart mechanics, understanding of the different engine types used across different race series, and through analysing data with a racer and their mentor, I learned the importance of teamwork and clear communication needed in high-pressure environments. This was reinforced when I spent a day down in the Formula E paddock with Girls on Track, where we were shown different roles in motorsport and how we could get involved with different motorsports at a younger age. I completed an online course with JLR, the highlight being designing a custom car, and justifying my design choices. I attended a course in London, hosted by InvestIn, where we explored the many different engineering fields and different engineers spoke about careers, mentioning the benefits and flaws. I volunteered at a local primary school to explore these subjects in further education. I ran interactive sessions, showing pupils how to create non-Newtonian fluids. I took part in a work experience programme, run by STEMETTES, where I helped deliver an event to primary school pupils and supported the design of online activities for the future. These experiences fuelled my desire to inspire and educate the next generation of STEM pupils.",

    "statement_full_text": "Engineering shapes every part of our lives, from the small details on our phones to the aircraft that transport people across the world. Each detail is crafted to enhance many different products. My interest in design and creativity began through playing video games, where I expressed myself by designing personal projects. This initial interest led me to pursue analytics behind social media trends. For my HPQ, I explored why videos go viral and the data related. This experience taught me to look beyond numbers and identify underlying patterns within them. The key turning point was visiting KROHNE, a local engineering company. I was fascinated by how complex products work in unison through precise measurement. My passion for aerospace engineering began with Formula 1, where aerodynamics and precision drive performance. I was captivated by the speed and intensity of the sport and listening to Susie Wolff and Claire Williams on Netflix's 'Drive to Survive,' I realised that, despite being male-dominated, motorsport offered different careers that I could aspire to pursue. I enrolled in an aerospace course where we explored the flight mechanics of foam gliders and designed a more optimised solution that would counter current weaknesses. This involved iterative testing and constant criticism of aerodynamic performance. Webinars hosted by InvestIn highlighted the realities of a career in engineering. I was drawn to the dynamic, unpredictability, and the demand for both adaptability and resilience. Next, I gained hands-on experience at Judd Power, utilising SolidWorks, where I designed 3D models, including an engine cover that was integrated into their design. This experience cemented my passion for design and my love for the fast-paced field of motorsport and aeronautics. Studying Product Design enhanced my interest in engineering and design, as it allowed me to develop skills, exploring CAD and CFD inspired me to do further research into their applications in engineering. I began watching Chain Bear on YouTube, discussing aerodynamics and taught me concepts, like downforce and vortex reduction. Managing the demands of my NEA coursework with three other subjects was a challenge, forcing me to develop my organisation and time management skills, ensuring I stayed on schedule and met personal deadlines. Pursuing Further Maths outside of school has been a challenge that has been pushed by my personal motivation. It has taught me the importance of self-directed study and of fully mastering a topic before moving on. In Physics and Maths Society at school, I presented complex topics such as the Dual-Axis Steering (DAS) system from the 2020 Mercedes F1 car, improving my confidence and communication of technical ideas. Beyond education, I took part in an online course run by TEDI. It was based on sustainable fashion, a topic that I had never considered for designing a product for, but found I really enjoy. This course challenged me to apply my design and reasoning skills in a new aspect of engineering and really pushed me out of my comfort zone. Outside of education, I am a member of my town's football team, where I have developed in skill, communication, and trust.
