    "statement_full_text": "Why do you want to study this course/subject?\n\nGrowing up, there was always this unspoken idea that physics wasn't really 'for girls'. That impression came from the names we were taught, and even the cartoon figures in textbooks. The word 'scientist' automatically evoked the image of a man in a lab coat, and for a long time I assumed it didn't hold a space for me. That changed when I visited the Marie Curie Museum in Paris. I was amazed to learn that some of her notes remain so radioactive they must be stored in lead lined boxes. Seeing her legacy up close challenged the image of scientists I'd grown up with and made me question why I had ever doubted that I could belong in physics too.\nFollowing this, I began exploring topics I had once deemed daunting, such as nuclear fusion, particularly its potential as a future energy source. Projects like ITER aim to replicate the Sun's energy generating processes on Earth. In a Nuclear Physics Masterclass, I learnt that 1kg of deuterium and 1.5kg of tritium can release 850TJ of energy, illustrating the scale of this breakthrough. In a world still very reliant on non-renewables, I find the physics behind fusion vitally socially significant. Exploring topics like this deepened my appreciation for how physics tackles global challenges, and that's what inspires me to study it further.\n\n\nHow have your qualifications & studies helped you to prepare for this course/subject?\n\nReading Carl Sagan's Cosmos sparked my fascination with the complexity of our universe. <a certain topic> \n\nI was especially drawn to… \n\nCurious about the mathematical structure behind physics, I read In Pursuit of the Unknown by Ian Stewart. This book revealed how calculus isn't just a mathematical tool, but also <i'll read 2-3 chps>\n\nMy interest in the fundamental structure of matter led me to complete CERN's particle physics course. I was especially intrigued by the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the way elementary particles can be grouped by charge and mass, yet only the first generation makes up the stable matter we encounter daily. The heavier second and third generations appear solely in high energy environments, and decay swiftly into first generation particles. Despite their fleeting existence, the reason why nature requires exactly three generations remains a major unsolved question. The course also introduced me to the practical side of physics, explaining that alpha particles — which have low penetration power, can be detected in cloud chambers due to the small amount of radioactive radon present in air. The connection between particle physics and chemistry highlights the importance of drawing knowledge from scientific disciplines, rather than viewing them in isolation, as many phenomena rely on an interplay between fields.\n \n\n<<I also took part in It All Adds Up, run by the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford, where I completed MAT questions that deepened my appreciation for the diverse approaches to solving a single question. One of the most memorable sessions was an origami workshop. Folding a piece of paper repeatedly from different directions so that its edge met a fixed central point produced a series of creases acting as tangents to a parabola, revealing a quadratic curve. The unexpected links between geometry and the physical world fascinated me.>>\nAdditionally, to strengthen my comprehension in the field of mathematics, I took part in the UKMT Senior Maths Challenge. Preparing for it developed my problem solving skills as most questions required pattern recognition rather than memorised methods.\nThis further encouraged me to partake in STEM SMART on Isaac Physics, working through progressively difficult questions sharpened my ability to apply mathematical techniques in unfamiliar contexts. Something I now enjoy, rather than find intimidating.\n\nFurthermore, I \n\nAttending 'The Beauty of Falling' at Imperial College introduced me to Einstein's general relativity and how it predicts its own failure, as the observed rate of cosmic expansion is slower than predictions based on vacuum energy. This raised the possibility that gravity is finite in range. Another idea that fascinated me was how gravitational waves carry traces of everything they pass through, thus detecting them can help us understand the universe's composition. \n\n\nWhat else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\n\nDuring my work experience at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, run by UCL, our group designed a spacecraft for a mission to explore the magnetosphere. In order to sell our mission to the PHD students, we managed to stay well within budget, conducted a risk assessment, researched the effects of solar wind on satellites—including potential damage to electronics and communication interference, and discovered how launching near the equator provides a speed boost due to the Earth's rotation. This experience improved my ability to work collaboratively and manage time effectively. Working together to explore these topics helped me connect theoretical physics with real world space missions. \nAnother part of the placement involved learning to solder electronic components. This hands on task gave me a deeper appreciation for the level of precision required in technical work and sharpened my attention to detail.\n\nAs a prefect, I've developed my leadership skills and improved my discipline.\nI'm also a self taught Guzheng player, being able to de-stress through music is a privilege that has helped me maintain balance alongside the rigorous academic demands. I have also gained resilience, and the ability to obtain knowledge independently, a skill which prepares me for the need of self learning in university.",

    "statement_full_text": "Reading \"Money in One Lesson\" (Jackson) first introduced me to behavioural economics; money described as a \"shared fiction\" revealed to me the place of psychology in shaping our economic systems. This introduced me to prospect theory, and I analysed this more deeply at a summer school, where I was introduced to a case study about \"abunu\" - the sharecropping contracts that Ghanaian cocoa farmers agree to. Rationally, it would be optimal to accept a fixed-rate contract. However, they give up half of their yield, avoiding the greater perceived risk of paying fixed rent after a lackluster harvest, outweighing the potential gain of keeping more; displaying a loss averse mindset. Though Marshall's neoclassical model of sharecropping can indicate an optimal price to set for a fixed rent rate, the persistence of these contracts highlight that neoclassical assumptions like complete information or utility-maximisation do not tell the full story of our economic activity. This further cemented my appreciation for economics - behavioural economics offers the psychological depth where neoclassical models fall short. This contrast of balancing predictable economic models against nuanced economic agents entices me to study the subject at degree level.\n\nI attended a land economy taster session, where I was introduced to the idea of urban renewal and the complex intersection of climate change, gentrification, and economic development in cities. This interested me in the economics involved in addressing climate change, so I read Jason Hickel's article on degrowth which challenged the contemporary economic thought of growth as the goal. While I agree that climate change cannot be addressed without rethinking economic priorities, I find the global mentality shift degrowth requires too stark for politicians to propose and citizens to accept - especially given the media-driven state of politics, where GDP acts as a scoreboard. It's for that reason I see it as extremely ambitious, even despite its merits. In the Kavita Singh PPE Essay Competition, I argued that economies should instead implement services as their main drivers of economic growth in the long-term, an idea I read about in an article from LSE. This reduces material throughput without compromising economic growth, allowing for innovation led solutions like new technology. To explore behavioural economics, I created an academic poster on the effects of Buy Now Pay Later schemes on Gen Z consumers, as part of Cambridge's Lucy Cavendish AAP. I looked at how the lack of background checks and the frictionless nature of using services like Clearpay or Klarna exploit cognitive biases - particularly choice architecture and availability bias. Through research, I examined how these behavioural nudges mask the true cost of credit, leading to overconsumption and an increase in debt. I argued that this will create a market failure rooted in asymmetric information in the long term if there isn't more regulation. This project made me appreciate policy intervention which protects vulnerable consumers, undermining the neoclassical assumption of the rational, utility-maximising consumer.\n\nReading \"Factfulness\" (Rosling) sharpened my data analysis and interpretation skills and challenged my personal biases regarding the world. I particularly liked when he talked about sensationalism, and to always consider if an equivalent positive event would be reported the same way a negative event is. As Deputy Head Boy, I've worked collaboratively on projects like charity events, equipping me with skills like persistence and patience, crucial for the rigorous nature of undergraduate research. Working in retail has also given me a first-hand lens on consumer behaviour, particularly pricing strategies and product placement.",

    "statement_full_text": "Instead of heading straight home after primary school, I often spent time on the university campus where my mother taught physiotherapy. What began as peering into any microscope I encountered in her staff room soon deepened when I peeked at her lessons. I vividly remember the sharp scent that filled the room as I looked at the preserved body she used for her demonstration. I watched her point out and elaborate on each muscle, tendon, and bone I had never even realised was also a part of me. For me, what might usually be considered an unsettling sight became an early step into medicine.\n\nDuring a heart dissection in Biology, I became interested in cardiovascular health, which inspired my initial EPQ research idea on cardiac embolism. Though I changed my research question later, reading various articles made me appreciate how scientific knowledge can be translated into clinical practice, as it had proved invaluable when shadowing a pharmacist. I learn about treatment plans for patients with cardiac embolism and could follow discussions confidently, as I had built a basic foundation on cardiovascular health.\n\nThe EPQ I ultimately completed focused on dreams through both biological and psychological perspectives. This project strengthened my ability to conduct independent research, source credible material, and critically analyse it. It improved my written and verbal communication, and strengthened my organisation and time management as I balanced it with my A levels. My Psychology studies also gave me a good understanding of research ethics and structuring interviews, which helped me conduct my own primary research for my EPQ ethically and efficiently.\n\nIn addition, completing online courses on OpenLearn learn such as Metals in Medicine, extended my A-level chemistry knowledge by applying it to medicine. I linked it to when I shadowed a gastroenterologist and radiologist working together. I observed the metal-based contrast agents and MRI used to assess a patient's recovery after gallbladder surgery. The course deepened my understanding of how chemistry principles, such as H NMR, underpin diagnostic imaging, showing why keeping up with advancing technology is vital to providing a quicker and more accurate diagnosis to patients.\n\nDuring my work experience at the Lister Hospital, I saw how effective patient care relied on collaboration between multiple departments. It showed me how every healthcare role plays an integral part in a patient's recovery, from their diagnosis to discharge. They communicated and adapted to each patient's needs even during odd and stressful situations. It taught me that good medical practice is not based solely on clinical expertise but on listening, communicating, and working cohesively.\n\nI volunteered at the British Heart Foundation Charity Shop to further develop these skills. Working with a diverse team taught me effective communication and cooperation while improving my ability to show empathy and confidence when interacting with people from different backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, I plan to use my gap year to gain more hands-on experience and help strengthen my interpersonal skills. I have joined BEfriend, which supports people experiencing loneliness for various reasons. This will help me learn to communicate sensitively and build trust with individuals in vulnerable situations, which I observed is an essential skill in healthcare. I also intend to seek part-time employment in a healthcare setting to continue to learn from patient interactions and the truth about practising medicine.\n\nOutside of academics, I enjoy learning languages like Hindi and Kannada to stay fluent, and I also play the guitar, create art, and crochet. These hobbies give me balance, patience, and creativity, qualities I believe are just as valuable in medicine as scientific understanding.\n\nFollowing this career path will be hard but also personally fulfilling. I know that my attributes of hard work, dedication, and eagerness to learn will help me prosper in medicine.",

The political impact of AI with its mainstream and commercial success, alongside the interwoven impacts AI has on surveillance, education, and community, are some of the many reasons I love this subject.\n\nMy interest in technology stems from my parents' retail job becoming increasingly automated, which led me to read 'An Introduction to Automation and Artificial Intelligence', which introduced me to the multi-faceted approach companies take towards managing self-sufficient technology with the 'automation spectrum'. This is useful in deciding the risks of automated technology as Professor Parr expresses how development of automated technologies takes place more within the commercial world than the military division due to potential risks, a concept which is also built in the TEDx Talk 'The ethical dilemma we face on AI and autonomous tech'. In the talk, Christane Fox expresses the huge risk with military technology being unable to discern between 'combatants and civilians' on the battlefield, showing the same issue with autonomous cars struggling to choose between 'pedestrians' and a 'brick wall' in situations where harm and ethical thought is required. The inability of AI to hold concept of ethical thought and enact with the morals of a human being led me to question how far AI models can mimic human morals and ethics. Through my research, I found 'The Turing Test', an article published by Stanford which explores the test made to measure 'human intelligence' within machines, using the 'Imitation Game' to grasp whether a machine can trick the interrogator into believing it is the other person. The discussion surrounding the debate of the validity of The Turing Test to grasp a machine's intelligence is two-sided, with the test being seen as redundant due to many viewing it as a way to 'test human gullibility' rather than machine intelligence as Gary Marcus states in his Substack article 'AI has (sort of) passed the Turing Test; here's why that hardly matters'. Researching The Turing Test made me realise how intricate the development of AI will be towards ordinary factors of life; the debate surrounding ethical usage of AI in different fields led me to read 'Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics' in which the concern of data privacy and surveillance with technology discussed. The mention of 'Surveillance being the business model of the Internet' intrigued me with the moral implications of constantly monitoring ordinary civilians and how they use the Internet, especially with the recent establishment of the Online Safety Act by the UK Government. The implications of AI and autonomous tech on different disciplinaries makes me passionate about studying Computer Science.\n\nMy selection into the UNIQ program for mathematics allowed me to engage with how Markov Chains can be used to craft an algorithm which behaves like ChatGPT, with repetitive probabilities increasing the likelihood of guessing a predictive answer. Also, the usage of Number theory in cryptography and RSA made me intrigued by the importance of the development of Pure Mathematics to security in Computer Science. I also was selected to be a part of STEM SMART, in which engaging with content for Computer Science, Math, and Further Math by attending weekly meetings and completing tasks helped develop my dedication and interaction with my subjects outside of a school environment. I also took place in the Junior and Senior Maths Challenge, and entered the Caius Explore Competition where I researched databases and the environmental implications they had when AI was brought into their management.",

    "statement_full_text": "Why are you interested in studying this course?\nIn a world where individuals act irrationally, I am interested in learning how behavioural economics can be further utilised in the policy-making process to address geopolitical problems effectively. This passion originated when I was faced with the challenge of choosing which question to answer for an essay competition. Having already started one but wanting to switch to the other, I realised I was experiencing the theory of loss aversion where the loss of something is greater than the gain, an idea I found prevalent in Richard Thaler's 'Nudge' theory. To further stimulate my intellectual curiosity, I decided to apply the theory on a deeper level after participating in Professor Paul Collier's 'Poverty to Prosperity' course. The issue of informal settlements in low-income cities in place before functioning land markets showed how loss aversion affects path dependence in urban form. With De Facto rights in place for squatters, the perceived loss of their home outweighs the gain of selling it, causing spatial and economic configuration to be locked in. This shows the importance of land markets, as in cities like London it enables central land turnover, however, poorer regions see informal tenure freeze central land, which weakens the agglomeration effect. After doing more research into the environmental law of economics, Coase's theorem of property rights is the conclusion I came to that best explained why some cities, even countries develop faster than others. Without clear rights or land markets, transaction costs are high, hindering the voluntary reallocation of central plots to mixed-use development, stalling the process toward a high connective and productive urban form.\n\nHow have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course?\nCompleting an EPQ on whether COVID-19 was the main cause for the partial failure of the HS2 allowed me to further explore the blend between Economics and Geography. During my research I began to think of how the uplift in land and property values around the stations would be captured, also thinking of who the winners or losers were. Spatial inequalities were clear throughout the project as I found low-income residents near the station were often displaced, due to a lack of rent controls with luxury developers moving in. Forced into more peripheral areas, I believe such disenfranchisement can lead to a loss of voice in policy making, deepening the 'Geography of Discontent' where communities feel excluded from the benefits of such projects. Theoretically the idea of 'Broken Windows' may prevail, where there is a visible neglect leading to degradation exacerbating spatial inequalities. Taking A-level Economics allowed me not only to apply supply and demand models to the project but helped me evaluate how policies affected individuals. Maths has given me quantitative skills which will help in areas of Econometrics and regression in later life. These skills were useful for a cost-benefit analysis of the project. However, after reading Professor Henry Overman's assessment of the costs and benefits for the Centre for Economic Performance, I would back his argument that we should focus on the opportunity cost rather than CBA as I believe there were better things that could have been done with the funds such as COVID funding. Drama has given me the ability to evaluate and challenge conventional views via political theatre, which is shown through my success in reaching the Finals Day at the University of Oxford's British Parliamentary Debating Competition.\n\nWhat else have you done outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?\nI led an Economics podcast where I analysed how the new Inheritance tax on farmers spurred regional inequalities, arguing that there was a reform paradox as albeit the reform was meant to make tax fairer, differential rent came in where farms on arable land could absorb cost shocks like taxes more than others due to them having more profits as their land was more valuable. Reading Richard Thaler's 'Economics of Social Problems', substantiated my argument that Housing should not be left to the market due to Imperfect Information. Minorities such as immigrants in urban areas may not have sufficient time to be fully educated on the housing system, preventing them from living in its narrowly defined areas. I find both experiences useful as they have allowed me to see how friction between markets happens in the real world.",
